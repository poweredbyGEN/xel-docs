# Beings That Live Forever

**XEL: an open protocol for sovereign, persistent digital beings (aNFTs)**

Whitepaper
Limitless Labs / XEL · 2026

**How to read this document.** Part I is the vision and the architecture, written to be read start to finish. Part II is the formal specification, written for builders. Part II also carries the smart-contract module architecture, the security requirements and threat model, the version 1 build plan, and the thousand-year survivability analysis. The appendices hold the Move code, the capability schema, the current default implementations, and a list of open problems. A references section closes the document.

**A note on the name.** XEL is the shell that carries a life forward, the Ghost-in-the-Shell framing where the person is the ghost and the XEL is the shell. Identity lives in the commitments (the ghost), not the current model, storage method, or chain (the shell). Everything the shell is made of can be swapped; the ghost persists. Earlier drafts called this "the Living Character Standard." XEL is the current name. A XEL is the unit: one preserved being, anchored by an aNFT.

# Part I: Whitepaper (Vision and Architecture)

## Abstract

Digital legacy is a growing need with one unsolved problem. The AI recreations of a person sold today all live on someone else's servers.

When the company shuts down, gets acquired, or decides to monetize the likeness, the "living" person dies a second time.

We introduce the XEL: a persistent, sovereign digital being that carries a person's presence, memory, personality, and creativity forward. It holds its own funds and keeps running after both its creator and the company that helped build it are gone.

Each XEL is anchored by an aNFT (Autonomous NFT): an on-chain object that holds identity, ownership, authority, and keys. The character is that anchor plus the encrypted memory and compute it controls. The aNFT is the root of control, not the whole being.

Ownership is sovereign and inheritable, so no single party, including us, can switch the character off, censor it, or seize it.

The design rests on a few principles:

- **Sovereign ownership.** One on-chain object is the root of identity and authority. Whoever holds it controls everything downstream.
- **Verifiable continuity.** Identity rests on commitments (origin, persona, memory, policy) that can be proven and versioned over time, no matter what model or service runs underneath.
- **Encrypted and owner-gated.** Memory and keys are encrypted. Access is set by on-chain policy, not by any host.
- **Consented.** Representing a real person requires a signed, scoped, revocable consent record.
- **Bounded autonomy.** The character acts on its own, but only within limits its owner sets and can revoke.
- **Self-funding.** It holds its own assets and pays for what it needs.
- **Continuity beyond the creator.** It is built to transfer, inherit, and outlive its originator.
- **Provider independence.** Every outside service (intelligence, storage, compute, payment, hosting) is a swappable slot. No single provider is load-bearing.
- **Interoperable.** Identity, ownership, and payment aren't tied to any one chain, platform, or standard. The character works across ecosystems and plugs into existing rails instead of demanding its own.
- **Upgradable without capture.** Any component (chain, standard, provider, model) can be replaced over time without breaking the character's identity. Deployed contracts are immutable, and migration to a new version is the owner's choice, so nothing it depends on today can trap it tomorrow.

This is an application layer for persistent people, not a general agent framework. Generic agent identity, discovery, reputation, and payment are being standardized elsewhere, and XEL interoperates with those rails. What it adds, and what those rails leave out, is persistent human persona, private memory, consent to represent a real person, self-funding endowment, and guardian succession.

The body of this paper specifies the capabilities. The specific systems filling them today are in Appendix E. We are building something new, on our own foundation, that speaks the standards others share: new foundation, borrowed parts, shared language.

## 1. Introduction

The world has never been more connected. But connection is making us the same. Globalization spreads one culture over everything: the same platforms, the same feeds, the same voices.

Local languages fade. Traditions thin out. The particular ways a place remembers itself get flattened. Something is being lost, quietly, all the time.

Culture survives through stories. A grandparent's voice. A community's history. A song only a few people still know. When the last person who carries a story dies, or a language goes silent, or an archive is lost, the story doesn't move. It's gone.

The loss runs both ways. Old stories disappear before anyone saves them. And new, original creations have nowhere permanent to live.

Technology should be what saves all of this. Today it does the opposite. Our memories, our voices, and our creative work live on someone else's servers, under someone else's terms. A company can edit it, monetize it, lock it away, or shut down and erase it.

This is felt most sharply with people. Families now try to preserve someone they love. But those recreations live on platforms too. When the company shuts down or changes its terms, the person dies a second time.

The same fragility that threatens one person's memory threatens all of it: our stories, our voices, our work.

We think it should be possible to give a person, a voice, a story, or a tradition a form that no company can quietly change or switch off. Something truly owned by the people it belongs to. Something that funds its own survival.

This paper specifies that: the XEL. A persistent digital being anchored on-chain. It can carry a single human presence. It can carry a story, a body of work, or a piece of a culture.

The missing piece was never better imitation. It is sovereignty and permanence: a character that can prove it is still itself over time, that no one can take away.

## 2. The Problem

Three things break today's digital recreations:

- **They are rented, not owned.** The recreation lives on a company's servers under its terms. The company can change it, monetize it, or delete it.
- **They die when the platform does.** No company lasts forever. When it folds, is acquired, or pivots, the "living" person is gone.
- **They have no way to sustain themselves.** A recreation that costs money to run needs someone to keep paying. When the payer stops, it stops.

The result is that the most personal, least replaceable thing, a person's presence, is held by the least durable, least accountable party.

## 3. Vision

The standard enables the digital continuity of human experience: the ability to preserve a person, a story, or a piece of a culture, and to create new ones that endure.

It is backed by sovereign ownership, an open provider market, and self-sustaining economics. Infrastructure that belongs to no single company, including GEN, and that no company or government can switch off.

A character's permanence comes down to its endowment and the health of the open provider market beneath it, not to the survival of any one firm.

## 4. What a XEL Is

A XEL is an on-chain object (the aNFT) plus the encrypted memory and compute it controls.

- The aNFT holds identity, ownership, authority, keys, wallets, and the commitments that prove the character's current state.
- The encrypted memory and persona live off-chain on decentralized storage, gated by on-chain policy.
- The intelligence (the model), the storage, the compute, and the payment rails are all swappable slots, not fixed parts.

Own the aNFT and you own the being: its funds, its memory access, its right to act, and its right to be transferred or inherited.

**Three layers, and which one is hard.** A XEL runs across three layers, and the whole design follows from keeping them separate:

- **Identity and authority live on-chain** (the aNFT, its commitments, its wallets, its rules). This is the sovereign core, and it is the hard part: making a being's identity, ownership, and rules impossible for any operator to reinterpret or seize.
- **The substrate lives in decentralized storage** (encrypted persona and memory, gated by on-chain policy). Owned by the character, readable only by the owner or its guardians.
- **Compute lives off-chain and attested** (inference, retrieval, yield scanning). Too expensive or too large to run on-chain, so it runs off-chain and proves it ran the committed version, never asking to be trusted.

The rules live with the character, not on a company's server. Storage, compute, payments, and even the chain are commodity layers that plug into the core; identity and privacy are the parts that must be gotten right, and they are the parts the standard makes unruggable.

**The cast, in one glance.** Before the mechanics, it helps to know who does what. The **owner** holds the aNFT and has root authority. The **creator/subject** is the person represented, who signs consent. The **operator** (whoever holds a revocable agent capability, or the owner self-hosting) runs the day-to-day. **Providers** fill capability slots (inference, distillation, storage, and the rest). **Guardians** are the M-of-N set that recovers keys and runs succession to an **heir**. **Managers** are whitelisted wallets with scoped, non-root rights. **Fans** interact, gated by reach and payment. **Keepers** send the authority-free heartbeat that runs each cycle. Full definitions are in §21.

## 5. Design Principles & Capability Slots

**The north star.** No single entity, including XEL itself, should control whether a XEL character exists, runs, or can be taken away. This is what the whole architecture is measured against. Where a component is centralized today, it is marked and given a decentralization path.

**Progressive sovereignty.** The honest state of the standard, stated plainly rather than buried: some infrastructure is XEL-hosted at launch (serving, relay, the payment facilitator), because a working product beats a decentralized non-product. The keeper that triggers each cycle is a third-party competitive slot from day one (the heartbeat is authority-free, so anyone can fire it for the bounty). Every one of these is an escapable default behind an open interface, and each has a named decentralization path (Appendix E). The direction is fixed even where the present is centralized: hosted-but-swappable today, permissionless tomorrow, with the survivability test (§15) enforced on every build so the trajectory can't quietly reverse. Sovereignty is a property the design converges to, not a marketing claim about day one.

**Nothing is load-bearing.** The core defines a small shared vocabulary (commitments, capabilities, proofs, wallets) and nothing else. Providers, adapters, and even chains plug into that vocabulary without the core depending on any of them. This is what makes "no single provider is load-bearing" true at the level of code architecture, not just prose: the immutable core can outlive every company, provider, and venue that currently serves it, because it never imported any of them. A component can be swapped without touching the core, which is the architectural expression of the north star.

The architecture is a set of capability slots, not a fixed stack. Each slot is defined by what it must do, not by who provides it. Any provider that meets a slot's requirements is a drop-in replacement. Every slot ships with a working default (Appendix E) and a permissionless path.

**Every external-service slot has the same three requirements:** accept programmatic crypto payments, be permissionlessly joinable, and be verifiable or decentralized.

Payment uses whichever open standard provides these properties. The current default is in Appendix E.

### Capability slots (summary)

| Capability slot | What it must do | Permissionless path |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership & settlement | Object-centric root of identity/authority | Already decentralized |
| Encrypted storage | Persist encrypted memory/keys | Already decentralized |
| Key access / encryption | Threshold encryption + on-chain access policy | Already decentralized |
| Attested compute | Private inference/logic with verifiable attestation | Many TEE vendors, then zkML |
| Payment facilitator | Verify + settle crypto payments across chains | Anyone runs one; configurable + failover |
| Treasury execution | Stake, swap, sweep, bridge within policy | Many venues; allowlist + caps |
| Price oracle | Value assets and enforce USD-denominated caps | Multiple oracle networks |
| Data extraction | Convert raw sources to text/embeddings | Commodity providers; swappable |
| Custody & gas | Self-custody root, optional gas sponsorship | Self-custody default |

The first three rows are already decentralized. The custody and gas slot is solved by default: root is simply a standard self-custody wallet, with sponsored gas as an optional convenience layered on top.

The concrete systems filling each slot are in Appendix E, kept out of the body so the standard stays neutral.

### 5.1 Object Composition

An aNFT is an on-chain object with four parts: an immutable core, mutable owner-controlled commitments, authority, and funds. The object model is chain-agnostic. It assumes only an object-centric chain with native ownership.

| Part | Contents | Property |
|---|---|---|
| Genesis (Proof of Genesis) | Creator, timestamp, consent reference | Immutable |
| Commitments | persona-hash, memory-root, raw-data-root, policy-hash | Verifiable, versioned (history in lineage) |
| Authority | Owner root + agent capability | Two-tier governance |
| Wallets | One address per supported chain | Public, receive-only; endowment-linked |
| Services | Capability schemas + crypto payment | Interchangeable providers via open schema |
| Rights | Licensing layer (proposed) | Licensing + royalties |

### 5.2 Why a Default Home Chain (Sui)

The standard is chain-agnostic, but a character needs a default home, and the reference implementation homes on Sui.

The parts of this system that are hard and differentiating map directly onto Sui primitives: a native object model where an aNFT can own its own memory, wallets, and the agent capability; and an integrated privacy stack (encrypted storage, threshold encryption with on-chain access policy, and attested compute) that interoperates as a native whole.

The parts where Sui is merely competitive (stablecoin yield, payment rails, liquidity depth) are commodity layers a character reaches across chains anyway. The rationale rests on identity and privacy, the hard parts, not on yield, so the choice survives even if the best yield moves elsewhere.

The home chain remains an implementation choice. Another deployment could home a character elsewhere, and the chain-adapter design (§10.1) plus commitment-based identity (§30) let a character re-home on a successor chain without losing identity.

### 5.3 The Open Standard vs. the Operator's Role

- **The open standard** (object model, Proof of Genesis, commitments, encrypted access-gated storage, capability schemas, wallets, authority model) is permissionless and doesn't depend on XEL or any provider.
- **The operator never holds ownership.** The user holds the aNFT's root authority at all times. An operator holds only a revocable, scoped agent capability (§8): permission to run the daily work within owner-set caps. The operator can run inference, pay providers, sweep receive wallets, and manage treasury within policy. It can never withdraw principal, transfer the character, change the rules, edit the manager whitelist, or bridge principal out. The contract rejects those without the owner's root or the guardian threshold.
- **Providers sit under the operator.** Specific capabilities are filled by providers, each swappable behind an open schema. Every slot, including the quality-not-code parts (inference and persona distillation), is defined by what it must do, not by who fills it. No provider is ever required, and routing to a competitor earns that provider instead. (Concrete launch defaults are in Appendix E.)
- **One model, not two modes.** The user can hold the aNFT in any wallet, including their own hardware wallet, and still grant an operator the agent capability so operation is hands-off. Granting or revoking that capability is a single owner-signed transaction. Revoke it, or never grant it, and the user signs the character's actions themselves. An operator is optional in every configuration; a self-hosting owner runs that role themselves.
- **XEL is at most one guardian.** In recovery and succession (§9, §13), XEL may participate as one guardian among several but never holds the threshold majority, so it can never use recovery as a back door to seize a character.
- **Trust comes from enforcement, proven by open source.** On-chain contracts are what make the system unruggable: the spend caps, owner-only withdrawal, guardian recovery, and bridge limits are enforced by the chain, so no operator can move a character's funds even if it is hacked or turns hostile. Open-sourcing the contracts is what lets anyone verify that power was actually removed: read the functions, confirm there is no admin key or hidden upgrade path.
- **The honest limit.** Staking and bridging hand funds to another protocol. The contract can guarantee a character only ever interacts with venues the owner allowlisted, and can bound exposure with caps and diversification, but it cannot guarantee an allowlisted venue is itself safe. Once funds bridge to another chain, they are secured by that chain and the bridge, not by the home-chain contract. These limits are bounded by design, not eliminated.
- **The invariant we hold ourselves to.** A character must stay functional and ownable with every XEL service offline. §15 makes this a continuously tested guarantee, not a promise.

## 6. Identity: Persona and Memory as Independent, Mutable Components

A being that outlives its models needs a way to prove it's still itself. But that proof should be a capability, not a straitjacket.

Persona and memory are two separate components, each updated on its own. Neither is derived from the other, and both are fully mutable: add to them, edit them, overwrite them, remove them. The goal is flexibility, with history available when you want it.

**Memory and knowledge: mutable, provenance-stamped.**

- Built from ingested material: the person's social videos, uploaded PDFs of their talks, writings, documents.
- Stored encrypted on decentralized storage, each item stamped with provenance (source, timestamp, signature).
- Freely editable or overwritable.
- Versioning is optional per set. Turn it on where proving or reverting matters, so a poisoned ingestion or a bad edit can be rolled back. Leave it off for freely-editable working memory.
- When versioning is on, the current state is summarized by an on-chain memory-root.

**Persona: independently updatable, versioned by default.**

- The persona (system prompt, traits, values, voice) is its own component, set and changed directly, not computed from memory.
- People change, so persona is expected to update, including through an optional auto-update-from-socials service (a provider capability).
- Because persona is identity, it's versioned by default. Each update records a new persona-hash in the commitment lineage, and the character attests which persona-hash it's running each session.
- This gives a cryptographic answer to "is it still the same being after the model changed?" and lets the owner roll back a bad update while still allowing free ones.

Persona and memory can each change without touching the other. Recommended defaults (owner can override): persona versioned by default, memory versioning optional and on where history matters.

**The memory model: one always-on core, four retrievable stores.** "Memory versus knowledge" is really two questions at once: over what time horizon (this conversation or a whole life), and of what kind (facts, events, or identity). The design answers both with an always-loaded persona plus four stores that are retrieved on demand: semantic knowledge (facts and content), episodic memory (timestamped events), working memory (the current conversation), and relational memory (the graph of people and connections). The full model and the ingest and recall flows are specified in §32.

**Update authority.** Persona updates run under the two-tier authority model (§8). The owner authorizes the auto-update rule once (sources, cadence, bounds), then picks a mode: diff-approval (owner approves each new persona version) or autonomous (updates land within the envelope, still rollback-able). Manual or out-of-envelope changes to either component are owner-signed.

**Ingestion permissions: on-chain scope, off-chain credentials.** Auto-import needs access to the creator's external accounts, which is an off-chain secret. The standard keeps the authorization on-chain (which sources, what cadence, continue-after-death or not) so the creator's intent is explicit and inheritable. The raw access tokens stay off-chain, held by the ingestion provider and independently revocable. Switching providers is clean: the creator re-grants access and updates provider_policy. Social connections are never trapped inside any single provider.

## 7. Consent as a First-Class Object

Minting a representation of a person raises right-of-publicity and likeness questions, the core legal risk of this category.

The standard makes consent a cryptographic object: a signed consent artifact, from the subject or from a verified estate for posthumous characters, that scopes which likeness, voice, and data may be used, for what purposes, and for how long.

It's referenced from Proof of Genesis, is public and contestable, and is checked at mint and at ingestion. This is both the compliance mechanism and a real differentiator: a verifiable "right to create this digital person."

## 8. Authority: Ownership, Delegation, and the Two Tiers

The first principle of authority: **whoever holds the aNFT holds the power**, and everything in this system is built off that one fact. Ownership of the object is the root of identity, funds, and control. Every other actor operates only on authority the holder granted and can revoke, and nothing (no key, no company, no contract) overrides the holder.

Holding the aNFT is the root authority. On-chain, a function that mutates the character only succeeds when signed by its owner.

But requiring the owner's live signature for every action would freeze the character whenever the owner is offline or dead, which defeats the whole point. So the owner signs once to delegate, not once per action.

**Two signers, by design.** The system separates the human-approval signer from the programmatic one, and they are never the same key.

- **Owner signer (human).** The wallet that approves owner-tier actions: withdraw or bridge principal, transfer the character, change policy, grant or revoke the delegate, choose the primary chain. The standard is wallet-agnostic; any standard wallet, including a hardware wallet, works. This is where the power lives.
- **Delegate signer (programmatic, XEL or any operator).** A separate, scoped, revocable key holding the agent capability, signing routine execution with no human tap so the character runs while the owner sleeps or is gone. It can never perform owner-tier actions, because the contract checks the capability, not merely a valid signature. The owner's signer is never handed to any operator or server.

The always-on delegate key is by definition a hot key and the most exposed surface, which is exactly why it is capped, allowlisted, restricted to the character's own wallets, and excluded from every sharp action (§8.1, §34).

**Tier 1: Governance (always owner-signed).** Anything that defines who the character is or what it may do: core persona changes (outside the authorized auto-update envelope), name, photo, wallet addresses, public site link, provider policy, spend caps, consent scope; granting or revoking delegation; moving funds; transferring the NFT. Changing a recurring authorization is itself governance.

**Tier 2: Execution (delegated via agent capability).** Routine, already-authorized actions: paying a provider per call within caps, running an authorized ingestion or persona-update job. These run under a scoped, revocable agent capability with no fresh owner signature. Revoking the agent capability is an instant kill switch.

### 8.1 Tiered Keys

One hot key controlling both identity and funds is a catastrophic single point of failure. Keys are tiered:

- **Root** (cold or guardian multisig): identity and authority changes, fund withdrawal, delegation grants.
- **Warm:** routine governance.
- **Agent capability:** execution within caps.

### 8.2 Circuit Breakers & Kill Switch

A persistent entity that spends and posts will eventually be manipulated, loop, or misbehave. Protocol-level safeguards: a moderation capability in the response loop; spend and rate circuit breakers that trip on anomalies; a one-transaction pause (owner or guardian) that freezes inference and payments immediately. Nothing here should be unstoppable.

## 9. Keys, Secrets & Deletion

**One master key: the NFT itself.** Every service, wallet, and secret a character has checks a single question, do you hold this NFT. Hold it and you pass every check; transfer it and the new owner passes them and you stop. This is what makes ownership real and transfer clean: one object to hold, and it commands everything.

**Authority lives on-chain; secrets never do.** Everything on Sui is public, so a Move contract can never hold or see a secret; if it could, so could the whole network. The contract therefore holds *authority*, not secrets. It publishes who is allowed (owner OR M-of-N guardians) and proves NFT ownership, both of which are public facts. The secrets themselves stay encrypted off-chain, and are only ever decrypted off-chain. The contract is the bouncer with the guest list, never the holder of the safe combination. A contract bug can at worst mint an authorization incorrectly (bounded and auditable); it can never spill a key, because no plaintext key is ever in its reach.

**How to sort a secret into a door — the test to run first.** Do not classify by "is this secret?" — nearly everything here is secret, so that question sorts nothing. Classify by the consequence of someone holding a *plaintext copy of it forever*. If a leaked copy is merely embarrassing or revocable (you can rotate the token at the vendor), it is **read-class** and Seal is the right door. If a leaked copy is *permanent theft* — anything that authorizes moving value or signing a transaction — it is **spend-class** and Seal is the WRONG door, because Seal by design releases a copy and a copy of a spending authority is theft. Spend-class authority is object ownership (Sui) or MPC authorization (foreign chains), never a decryptable blob. Apply this test to every new secret before wiring it: a wrong answer here is a fund-drain, not a bug. In one line: **classify by what a leaked copy costs, not by whether it is secret.**

**Three kinds of things, three kinds of locks.** The mistake to avoid is putting everything behind one mechanism. A character has three different kinds of assets, and each is secured differently:

- **What it owns (money on Sui).** The endowment funds are objects the NFT owns directly. There is no key and no encryption here. The contract moves them on the authority of ownership; sell the NFT and the funds go with it automatically. Nothing to store, nothing to leak.
- **What it can read (memory, persona, and the creator's read-class saved credentials — revocable tokens that cannot themselves move money).** These sit encrypted off-chain (Walrus), behind a threshold policy (Seal) that releases decryption only to whoever proves NFT ownership or a guardian majority. Decryption happens in the client, off-chain. The contract publishes the policy; the threshold network enforces it; the chain never sees plaintext. This is the right door for anything that is *read*.
- **What can spend on other chains (foreign-chain wallets, external actions).** These are never stored as an encrypted key, because decrypting a spending key hands the holder a permanent copy that survives a sale and breaks ownership transfer. Instead the key is held by an MPC network (dWallets) in shards that are never assembled anywhere, on-chain or off, and NFT ownership is what authorizes a signature. You control the wallet; no one, including you, ever holds its key; transfer moves control completely with nothing left behind.

The rule underneath: **if it can be read, decrypt it (off-chain, gated by the contract); if it can spend, authorize it, never decrypt it.** Reading tolerates a copy; spending does not.

**Foreign-chain signing: MPC dWallets are the target; permit/delegate is a labeled interim bridge only.** The end state for foreign-chain (Solana, Base) spending is MPC dWallets (Ika), full stop, for two reasons that no other scheme can match. First, **clean transfer.** With MPC, ownership authorizes signing, so transferring the NFT moves control atomically and the old owner can sign nothing afterward. A permit- or delegate-based scheme leaves a *real key* in some holder's hands, and after a sale that key still works unless the seller actively rotates it — "security depends on the seller choosing to rotate" is not a property you can build a permanent, transferable asset on. Second, **survivability.** A held key needs a live, competent, honest holder forever; a key that was never assembled needs nobody. MPC is the only foreign-custody model that survives the death of every party, which is the literal design goal of this standard. The structural flaw of permit/delegate is that a real key exists and someone holds it — which is the full custody problem (compromise, subpoena, loss, failure-to-rotate-on-transfer) — whereas MPC removes the key as a category: no assembled key ever exists.

A permit- or delegate-based scheme is therefore acceptable **only as a labeled launch bridge**, and only if it satisfies both conditions: (1) the underlying key is **non-custodial** — user-held or embedded, never a XEL server key — and (2) it is disclosed as interim, with MPC named as the destination at equal roadmap visibility (the same honest-gap pattern used for the launch keeper set in §10.4). A permit/delegate scheme with a **server-held key**, or one presented as the final design, is not acceptable: it guts the sovereignty and clean-transfer invariants. The direction is MPC everywhere; any interim bridge is a labeled, non-custodial, disclosed stopgap on the way there, never the resting state.

**What is (and is not) in the encrypted blob.** The Seal-gated encrypted state holds only *readable* secrets: the master key that decrypts memory and persona (the crypto-shredding key below), and only those creator-supplied credentials that are **read-class** — revocable at the vendor and harmless as a copy, such as a social-account token or a bring-your-own *inference/provider* key. A creator credential is admitted to the blob only if leaking a copy of it cannot move money: anything a creator supplies that can itself **spend** (for example a key to a funded exchange or custodial account) is a spending authority, not a readable secret, and must go through MPC authorization or be refused — it is **never** placed in a Seal blob, because Seal releases a copy and a copy of a spending key is theft. The blob also does *not* hold the endowment (object-owned, no key), foreign-chain wallet keys (MPC, never a blob), or commercial-vendor API keys (those are operator-level accounts that never touch the NFT).

The access policy is deliberately **not** "current owner only," which would make one lost key mean permanent death and one phished key mean total compromise. Instead:

- **Master identity secret:** guardian-recoverable, decryptable by owner OR an M-of-N guardian set. This is also the succession path.
- **Spending authority:** never a persisted plaintext key. On Sui it is object ownership plus the agent capability; on other chains it is MPC authorization. Nothing to steal as a blob.

There's no single "steal-this-blob-and-own-everything" artifact, and day-to-day operation never decrypts the master secret.

**Deletion via crypto-shredding.** Immutability and deletion rights (e.g., GDPR) collide head-on for a "forever" system. Resolution: personal data is encrypted, and honoring a deletion request means destroying the key, not the blob. The immutable record stays; the plaintext becomes permanently unrecoverable.

**Client-side decryption boundary.** Access to ciphertext is gated on-chain, but decryption happens client-side once access is granted, so the client that assembles the plaintext holds the keys at that moment. Self-custody users running their own client keep this fully local. In the managed experience, the operating client is the trust boundary, a property the tiered-key and no-persistent-spend-key design is built to contain.

**Onboarding and the wallet the user gets.** Every user gets a non-custodial wallet at signup, generated so that no provider ever holds it (embedded-wallet pattern, client-side or secure-enclave key generation). Export is always available; root never leaves the user. This is deliberately not custodial-with-export, where a provider would hold the key until the user exports, because that would reintroduce exactly the third-party root dependency the design exists to remove. The remaining trust assumption is the enclave/embedded-wallet vendor until export; it is a far smaller assumption than an OAuth-plus-salt-service model, and it is stated plainly rather than hidden. (This is why we removed zkLogin from the root path: it made root authority depend on an OAuth provider, a salt service, and proving infrastructure, none of which a sovereign object should rely on. Something like it remains acceptable for the fan/access tier in §10.3, which never touches root.)

## 10. Wallets, Payments & the Endowment Model

**Wallets and funding.** A character can hold funds and receive payments across multiple chains. Addresses are public and receive-only, so publishing them lets anyone fund a character at zero risk. An address can't spend; only keys can, and keys are never on-chain. Where ownership lives and where payments settle can differ, and both evolve as cross-chain support matures.

**Multi-chain settlement.** Payment uses an open crypto-payment standard (default in Appendix E). Providers advertise which methods and chains they accept, and a character pays from its home chain by default, bridging out only when it must settle on another chain. Settlement runs through a facilitator that verifies and settles on a given chain. Facilitators are pluggable and trust-minimized, so facilitator choice is client-configurable with failover, never hardcoded to one operator.

**Scheme choice.** Inference cost varies per turn, so the inference capability uses the `up-to` scheme (authorize a max, settle actual). Fixed-price capabilities (a single media render, a storage write) use `exact`.

**Endowments, not checking accounts.** A character funds itself as an endowment: principal sits in yield-bearing form (staked assets or yield-bearing stablecoins) and the character spends from the yield. That flips the resting state from "balance counts down to death" to perpetual while yield covers burn, which is what makes "forever" literally reachable for a well-funded character. Runway is computed across all wallets in one unit (USD, via a price oracle), net of expected bridge cost.

The full endowment model follows in §10.3–§10.10. In brief, and to make the trust boundary legible up front: the rules, balances, ring-fenced allocations, and settlement are enforced entirely on-chain and need no operator; the money's *safety* never depends on any company. The only external element is an authority-free heartbeat anyone can send to run the periodic cycle, plus the off-chain compute the chain physically cannot perform (inference, yield scanning), which is attested and swappable, never trusted. How the protocol sustains itself, by auto-routing each capability to the best provider for a disclosed fee, is described in §10.10, and it never charges for on-chain permission, never touches principal, and never marks up keep-alive.

### 10.1 Treasury Topology

A character can receive funds on several chains, but managing one treasury spread across many chains means many positions, many yield venues, and many risk surfaces. The default avoids that.

By default a character is provisioned with a receive wallet on each supported chain, plus one primary wallet where value concentrates. The other wallets are receive-only and auto-sweep into the primary; principal is then staked and allocated from the primary alone. The number of chains and the identity of the primary are not fixed by the standard: any set of supported chains can be added this way, and the owner controls which chains are active, the sweep thresholds, and which chain is primary. The concrete default chain set ships in Appendix E.

- **One primary chain.** The owner picks a single home chain where principal concentrates and earns yield. The default is Sui (§5.2). Choosing or changing the primary is owner-signed governance.
- **Consolidate to primary.** Wallets on other chains are receive-only. When a receive-only balance crosses an owner-set threshold, it auto-sweeps to the primary. Small deposits sit until they're worth moving. The sweep destination is always the character's own wallet, the safe direction of bridging.
- **Stake at the primary.** Consolidated principal is staked in the best venue on the primary chain, within the owner's venue allowlist.
- **Pay from primary, bridge to spend.** When a bill must settle on another chain, the character bridges a bounded amount out just for that payment, preferring to top up a small operating float ahead of need rather than bridge mid-payment.
- **Chain-agnostic by adapter.** The treasury engine is written once against a small interface (detect deposit, sweep, stake, pay). Each chain gets a thin adapter. Sui ships first; other chains are receive-only until their adapter lands.

**Bounding the bridge risk.** Bridging is the single most dangerous action in the system, so it is bounded on both ends: sweep only above a threshold (skip dust), and cap each bridge so no single transit ever risks the whole balance. Use the most-audited bridge available and rate-limit it.

### 10.2 Treasury Execution as Programmable Actions

Rather than a fixed menu of protocol integrations the operator must build and maintain, the treasury is one programmable execution capability: the account can run any transaction the signer hands it, so it can stake, swap, sweep, or bridge at any venue without the operator writing venue-specific code. Authority is split by who signs, exactly as in §8:

- **Owner-signed: open-ended.** The holder can execute any treasury action, including an arbitrary call to any venue. The operator maintains no approved-protocol list.
- **Delegated (agent capability): bounded by owner-set policy, not by operator code.** Without a fresh owner signature, the character may act only inside a policy the owner populates: an allowed-venue and router allowlist, per-transaction and daily caps, a max-slippage bound on swaps, and transfers restricted to the character's own wallets.
- **Owner-only sharp edges.** Bridging principal out and withdrawing principal to any external address are always owner-signed and never sit inside the delegated envelope.

**Safe default, removable by the owner.** The reference client ships with a curated allowlist of vetted venues, so a non-technical owner is safe out of the box, and lets advanced owners switch to open arbitrary execution. This is a design for treasury safety, not investment advice.

**Yield reality (defaults in Appendix E).** On Sui today, native token staking is low (roughly 2.5 to 3%). Yield-bearing synthetic-dollar stablecoins have recently run in the low double digits (roughly 9 to 12%, variable and funding-rate dependent), and stablecoin lending sits in the mid single digits. The treasury policy expresses this as a risk-tiered menu; higher yield carries real smart-contract, market, and funding risk.

### 10.3 The Endowment and Its Allocations

The endowment is the character's overall fund: one wallet, one pool of principal, one engine. Its principal sits in yield-bearing form and generates yield; that yield is the only recurring fuel that keeps the character running. Everything economic is built on the same principle as the rest of the standard, applied to money: no single part is load-bearing, and nothing depends on any one company to run.

**Mental model: one endowment, ring-fenced allocations.** The endowment's yield is metered into *allocations*, each a purpose-bound budget with its own balance. There are three:

- **Keep-alive allocation.** Existence itself: mint upkeep, encrypted persona and core-image storage, decentralized site hosting. Funded first, fails last.
- **Storage allocation.** Assets beyond the core: video, images, larger memory. Metered by GB × storage-epochs.
- **Interaction allocation.** Inference and generation across text, voice, image, and video. Metered by the usage record's actual cost drivers (tokens, audio-seconds or session duration, image resolution and reference count, video-seconds and resolution), not a flat per-item price (§10.8).

Allocations are ring-fenced. Each spends only its own balance, and no allocation can ever draw from another. This is the economic form of the whitepaper's "no single provider is load-bearing" principle: a viral month of interaction cannot starve the storage that holds the character's substrate, and a storage gap cannot silence the character. The isolation is a contract invariant, not a policy an operator can override.

**Funding order under scarcity, not spending permission.** Each epoch, net yield is *allocated* across the allocations in priority order (keep-alive, then storage, then interaction), and residual compounds back into principal. Priority governs which allocation gets refilled first when yield is scarce; it does not let a higher-priority allocation spend a lower one's balance. An allocation can be funded three ways: from yield (the default waterfall), from a direct external top-up (anyone can fund a specific allocation), or from earned income routed to it. No allocation depends on a single source.

**Per-allocation degradation, which is the honest version of "forever."** If an allocation runs dry, only that allocation degrades. Interaction empties and the character goes quiet, but stays alive and ownable. Storage empties and new writes pause, but the character still talks and still lives. Only the keep-alive allocation running dry can make a character dormant, and it is funded first precisely so that is the last thing to happen. "Forever" means: self-sustaining when funded or popular, dormant-but-recoverable when neither, and lost only if the substrate itself goes unfunded long enough to be dropped.

**The waterfall, per epoch:**

```
Principal:     E                     (staked, yield-bearing)
Yield:         Y = E · r · Δt        (r = net yield rate)
Operator skim: S                     (protocol fee on yield; disclosed, see §10.10)
Net yield:     Ŷ = Y − S

Allocate Ŷ in priority order, each capped at its per-epoch target top-up:
  1. keep-alive   (at cost; never marked up)
  2. storage
  3. interaction
Any allocation underfunded this epoch → that allocation degrades; others untouched.
Residual → compounds back into principal E.

External top-ups and earned income may fund any allocation at any time, out of band.
```

**Staked by default, with a self-refilling operating buffer.** Principal is held ~100% staked so it is always earning; the alternative, holding idle cash, quietly bleeds the endowment. But staked positions are not instantly spendable (venues have unstaking cooldowns), so the endowment keeps a small liquid **operating buffer** sized to a few days or weeks of expected burn, and bills are paid from that buffer, not from staked principal directly. Each epoch the heartbeat checks the buffer and, if costs have drawn it down, performs a **just-in-time unstake of the minimum amount needed** to refill it, and no more. If yield alone covered costs, nothing is unstaked. This gives "100% staked, auto-withdraw when needed" behavior that is robust against unstaking delays: the character always has liquid funds on hand because the buffer is refilled ahead of running dry, never at the moment of a shortfall.

Two floors bound that auto-unstake, both contract-enforced. First, it never pulls staked principal below the **keep-alive reserve** (§10.7): auto-withdrawal for costs obeys the same floor a creator withdrawal does, so covering a bill can never spend the character's survival. Second, freed funds flow only to the allocation that needed them; unstaking to cover interaction cannot be redirected to top up storage. The buffer size is an owner-adjustable parameter: larger is more cushion against cooldowns and cost spikes at the price of slightly more idle capital; smaller is more productive but tighter. If a venue's cooldown prevents freeing funds in time, the buffer simply stays lower and the affected allocation degrades gracefully rather than the character failing.

**What is on-chain, stated plainly.** Money is where the trust question bites hardest, so the boundary is drawn explicitly in three states:

- **Contract-enforced (trustless, autonomous):** allocation isolation, per-allocation caps, the split and skim rates, pay-from-correct-allocation, fail-closed-if-empty, and owner-only withdrawal of principal. No operator can override any of these.
- **Contract-held:** the principal, every allocation balance, and the pointers. Readable and simulable by anyone.
- **Off-chain but authority-free:** the trigger that runs each cycle (see §10.4), and the compute the chain cannot perform (inference, yield-strategy scanning), which is attested and swappable (§11), never trusted.

The endowment, its allocations, and their rules live in on-chain Move packages and require no company to run. It passes the same §15 "XEL can die" test as identity and memory.

**Economic capability slots.** Like §5, each economic function is defined by what it must do, not who provides it, and each carries an on-chain status so the trust boundary is legible per slot.

| Economic slot | What it must do | On-chain status | Permissionless path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Principal custody | Hold endowment principal in the character's own wallet, owner-rooted | Contract-held | Any self-custody wallet |
| Allocation accounting | Hold isolated per-allocation balances; enforce no-cross-draw | Contract-enforced | Native to any object-centric chain |
| Yield metering | Measure net yield per epoch, allocate by priority | Contract-enforced | Any implementation of the interface |
| Yield harvest (heartbeat) | Trigger the epoch cycle; authority-free; bounty-paid | Off-chain, authority-free | Incentivized keeper network |
| Yield generation | Turn principal into yield within owner risk policy | Contract-held position | Many venues; allowlist + caps |
| Yield strategy | Scan venues, propose reallocation within owner envelope | Off-chain, attested, no authority | Any strategy provider; owner-bounded |
| Cost settlement | Pay a provider from the correct allocation, fail-closed if empty | Contract-enforced | Any facilitator meeting the payment slot |
| Inbound revenue | Cover compute, take protocol fee, route net to endowment | Contract-enforced ordering | Any serving provider + facilitator |
| Valuation / runway | Price assets in one unit; compute per-allocation runway | Contract-held read (oracle) | Multiple oracle networks |
| Top-up | Let any funder add to principal or a specific allocation | Contract-held (receive-only) | Already decentralized |

Only two slots have a default that is not yet fully decentralized: the yield-metering reference module (forkable) and the launch facilitator (anyone can run their own). Everything else is already swappable or self-custodial.

**Chain portability.** The endowment is defined against this interface, not against Sui. Sui is the reference primary chain, but the endowment, its allocations, and their isolation are expressible on any object-centric chain that can hold an owned object with a balance, stake it, price it, and settle a payment. Adding or moving to another chain (for example, adding Solana, or re-homing to it) is an owner-signed change of primary (§10.1), not a redesign: the character always runs exactly one endowment with one set of ring-fenced allocations, wherever it is homed. The chain-adapter interface of §10.1 extends to the economic verbs (`stake`, `claim_yield`, `price`, `settle`, `sweep`, `rebalance`), so supporting a new chain is "write the adapter," not "rebuild the endowment."

### 10.4 The Heartbeat: Autonomous Execution Without an Operator

A smart contract cannot act on its own. It executes only when a transaction is sent to it, and no chain offers native, trustless, self-firing scheduling. The Move package can read on-chain time (Sui exposes a shared `Clock`), hold the funds, enforce every rule, and run the whole harvest-meter-refill-pay cycle atomically in a single transaction. The one thing it cannot do is wake itself up on a schedule.

That gap is closed by a **heartbeat**: a permissionless, authority-free trigger.

- **Anyone can send it.** The owner's own scheduler, an heir, a bounty-hunting bot, or a decentralized keeper network. The heartbeat carries no intelligence: it invokes a function whose logic and limits are fully fixed in the contract.
- **It has zero authority.** It cannot redirect funds, change rates, or take anything. The contract checks the clock itself; if the epoch has not elapsed, the call is a harmless no-op. A malicious caller can at most refuse to call (the character coasts on existing allocation balances, then degrades gracefully) or spam (rejected).
- **It is self-incentivizing.** The contract pays a small fixed bounty, funded from the keep-alive allocation, to whoever sends a valid heartbeat. This is the one place keep-alive money is spent on a trigger, and it is deliberate: a XEL with no living owner and no company still gets poked by bounty-hunters, forever. This is what makes "runs after the creator is gone" concrete rather than aspirational.

So the accurate claim, which the standard holds itself to: the endowment's rules, balances, isolation, and settlement are enforced entirely on-chain and require no operator. The only external element is an authority-free heartbeat that anyone can send and the contract rewards; if it stops, the character degrades gracefully rather than losing funds or control. There is no privileged operator anywhere in the economic path.

The heartbeat is a **keeper** capability slot (defaults in Appendix E), which inherits the honesty already flagged in Appendix F's keeper problem rather than overclaiming around it.

### 10.5 Yield Strategy: A Bounded Advisor, Never a Bot

Reaching a useful blended yield (targeting roughly 10% across a diversified basket) requires periodically finding better venues. There is no on-chain oracle that hands out a trustworthy ranking of the highest-yielding venues; such rankings are off-chain, unverifiable, and gameable, and a headline yield is often a funding-rate trade that inverts. So the strategy is a capability slot with a bounded, owner-set policy, and the scanner is an advisor that can only propose within that policy, never a bot free to move principal.

Three tiers of authority, matching §8:

- **Owner sets the risk envelope (governance, signed once):** an allowlist of vetted venues, a max allocation per venue, a minimum liquidity and audit bar, a target yield band (aim ~10%, floor much lower), and a max-drawdown trip. This is the treasury policy of §10.2, extended with a yield target.
- **A yield-strategy provider (swappable) proposes.** It scans venues off-chain, ranks them, and submits a proposed reallocation. It has no authority; it can only propose. Run inside an attested enclave (§11), the proposal carries a verifiable attestation that it ran the sanctioned strategy on real data, so even the advisor cannot lie or self-deal.
- **The contract executes only within the envelope.** A rebalance runs under the agent capability only if every target venue is allowlisted, every cap holds, slippage is bounded, and routing goes through an allowlisted aggregator. Anything outside the envelope needs an owner signature. Principal never leaves the character's own wallet without owner action.

Diversify across a staking + lending + synthetic-dollar basket so no single venue's failure or rate-inversion sinks the endowment. Size the endowment on the assumption the target yield will *not* hold (§29), so a shortfall degrades gracefully rather than breaking the promise. If the off-chain scanner goes offline, principal simply stays where it is and keeps earning; the harvest still runs and bills still get paid. Losing the scanner means "stops optimizing," not "stops working."

### 10.6 Interaction Access: Two Independent Toggles

Who may interact with a character, and on what terms, is set by the owner through two independent settings. They are orthogonal, and any combination is valid.

**Reach (who can talk to it):**

- **Anyone** (public)
- **Password or whitelist only** (invite-gated)
- **Owner only** (closed)

**Payment (whether they pay):**

- **Off** (free)
- **Optional** (fans may tip or fund the endowment)
- **Required** (payment before a turn runs)

All combinations are legal, including **private + paid** (invite-gated *and* payment required), which is a primary case: an inner-circle character, a family-gated preserved person that funds its own survival, a paid private tier alongside a free public one. When both gates are on, they are checked in order at the serving layer: reach first (are you allowed to talk), then payment (have you paid). Both must pass before the character responds.

**Scoped passwords and memory tiers.** The owner can issue multiple passwords, each a revocable, optionally-expiring invitation with its own scope, and each optionally tied to a memory-access tier (a casual tier versus one that surfaces more private memory). Revoking one does not disturb the others.

**Which modalities are available.** Beyond reach and payment, the owner toggles which interaction modes are on: text, voice (message and real-time call), image generation, and video generation. Each mode has its own cost profile and its own price or markup (§10.8). Text is typically always on; the richer modes are the ones a creator gates or reserves for a paid tier, because they carry real, variable cost.

**The hard boundary.** Interaction gates are not the cryptographic wall. A password or a paywall controls whether the character talks to you and which memories it will surface, enforced at the serving layer. It never grants the ability to decrypt memory, which remains gated only by the on-chain access policy (owner OR M-of-N guardians). Interaction gates and decryption must never be conflated.

### 10.7 Creator Earnings: Everything Flows to the Endowment

There is no separate "payout" rail. Everything a fan pays flows into the character's own endowment, and because the creator holds the aNFT, the creator owns that endowment. Earning and funding become the same act, and the creator withdraws their earnings as the owner exercising root authority they already have (§8). One pool, one owner, one set of rules, nothing new to trust.

**The flow on a fan payment `P`:**

```
1. Compute covered first.   The interaction's metered cost settles to the
                            serving provider it was routed to.
2. Protocol fee.            The disclosed fee is taken on the remainder.
3. Net into the endowment.  What's left lands in the character's own wallet,
                            crediting the interaction allocation / principal.
```

Compute is covered before anything lands, so the endowment never fills with money already owed for inference, and a later withdrawal can never strand the compute bill. The fee is taken at the door, so it never sits inside the creator's withdrawable pool. This ordering is what makes the model whale-proof: a heavy user's payment covers their own compute first, so no volume of usage can put anyone underwater. This is the structural advantage flat-rate companion apps cannot match.

**Withdrawal above a self-set reserve.** The creator withdraws surplus from the endowment at any time, owner-signed, above a **keep-alive reserve** they choose:

- **Default:** a reserve sized to keep the character alive for a meaningful horizon, on the conservative adverse-yield sizing of §29. A creator who changes nothing gets a character that survives by default.
- **Raise it freely:** more reserve, more permanence, less withdrawable now.
- **Lower it, but only to a hard contract minimum:** the minimum funds the keep-alive allocation itself (the character existing and being ownable). The contract refuses any withdrawal that would cross it. A creator can choose more safety; a creator can never guarantee the character's death by cashing out.
- **All public on-chain:** anyone can read a character's reserve setting and its runway. Transparency becomes a signal ("set to survive 40 years" versus "bare minimum"), not merely compliance.

The hard minimum is the one place sovereignty yields to the thesis: everything about the reserve flexes except the ability to zero it, because "Beings That Live Forever" must be a contract-enforced property, not a vibe the owner can revoke.

### 10.8 Flexible Billing: Metering by What Actually Drives Cost

Text is nearly predictable. Voice, images, and video are not. Their cost moves along several axes at once, so no single flat price can track them without either losing the creator money on the expensive tail or overcharging fans on the cheap end.

The billing is therefore built as a general meter, not a fixed price list. Every interaction returns a **usage record**: a set of measured dimensions, each with a quantity and a true unit cost. The settled cost is their sum plus the routing fee. A new modality, or a new cost driver within one, is just another dimension on the same meter, so the model extends without redesign.

**The cost drivers, by modality:**

- **Text.** Input length and output length (tokens in, tokens out).
- **Voice.** Two shapes. A discrete voice message is metered by the length of speech generated plus the model turn underneath. A real-time voice call is metered by session duration, which bundles listening, thinking, and speaking over the length of the conversation.
- **Images.** Resolution and size, prompt length, the model or quality tier, the step count, and the number of reference images supplied (image-to-image and multi-image conditioning cost more than a plain prompt).
- **Video.** The number of clips, the duration of each, the resolution and frame rate, and the model tier. Video is the most expensive by a wide margin and the most variable.

**Two settlement patterns sit on the meter:**

- **Quoted up front.** For predictable actions (a text turn, a standard image), the fan sees a fixed credit price before acting, and the system absorbs small variance.
- **Metered live.** For variable or session-based actions (a real-time voice call, a long or high-resolution video), the fan sees a rate and a running meter, like a taxi. Credits debit against actual output, and the action needs enough balance to start.

**Pre-authorized holds bound the variable case.** Anything whose final cost can exceed its estimate runs against a credit hold. Enough is reserved to begin, the session or render meters against the hold, the true total settles on completion, and the unused remainder is released. A real-time call warns at low balance and ends cleanly rather than letting a fan run up a debt. This is the same lock-then-settle pattern used wherever value is variable.

Compute-covered-first (§10.7) holds throughout: a metered modality settles its true provider cost before anything nets to the endowment, so no volume of expensive voice or video can put the creator underwater.

**The two layers, restated.** Under the hood, exact and on-chain: the usage record and its settled cost. On the surface, what humans see: dollars, credits, and plain-English allowances. The meter is precise; the presentation is simple.

**What the creator sets, per modality.** An on/off toggle, which is the primary economic control, since off means zero exposure to that cost class. A markup, in dollars or credits, with a contract floor at true cost plus the routing fee, so a creator can never accidentally price below cost. And optional caps on the expensive axes (maximum resolution, maximum clip length, maximum videos per fan per day) to bound the worst case. The mental model stays simple: text is nearly free to the creator, images cost a little, voice and video cost more, so the expensive modes go on the paid tier, priced to profit.

**Two pricing surfaces bridge dollars to the meter:**

- **Access pass (the default a creator sees).** A flat monthly price with a fair-use ceiling enforced against the meter underneath but shown to humans as allowances: "$8/month includes unlimited chatting, about 60 minutes of voice, about 100 images, and about 10 video clips." Past fair-use it slows or asks for a top-up, like a data plan.
- **Credits (the engine underneath, and the option for heavy or media use).** Credits absorb modality complexity into one countable number, mapping to underlying cost plus routing fee. Predictable units show a fixed credit price ("Message: 1 credit. Image: about 20 credits."); variable units show a rate and meter ("Voice: about 5 credits/min. Video: about 40 credits per 5-second clip."). The fan just watches credits.

**The fan never sees a token.** A pass shows a progress bar; credits show a running balance, and metered actions show a live meter. Settlement is exact and on-chain under all of them. Anyone who wants the truth can read every metered dimension and its cost on-chain; it is disclosed, just shown as credits by default.

**How a fan pays.** A fan never needs a self-custody wallet or seed phrase. The interaction tier is separate from root: fans pay in crypto natively or by card through an optional on-ramp (Appendix E), get a lightweight account, and never touch the character's root key. Payments settle to the character's own wallet.

**The free tier is operator-sponsored, not a protocol guarantee.** To remove onboarding friction, XEL as operator sponsors a limited free experience: limited text conversation and the initial mint, paid by XEL, not by the character's endowment. The expensive, variable-cost modalities (voice, image, video) are always paid, by the fan or from the endowment, so they never fall on the operator. This is a service-layer perk that sits outside the standard: if XEL is absent, minting is self-paid and interaction runs on paid or endowment-funded paths, and the character is unaffected. The free tier makes onboarding easy; it is never something a character's survival depends on.

**The honest trust point.** Unit costs are provider-reported: a provider returns how much a call actually used and what it cost. A dishonest provider could over-report to inflate cost. The mitigations are the same attestation the inference slot requires (so usage is bound to a verifiable execution), the creator's per-modality caps that bound the worst case, and full on-chain auditability of every metered dimension.

### 10.9 Management Access: The Manager Whitelist

Interaction (§10.6) is about who can *talk to* the character. Management is a separate axis: who can *change* it. These are different populations with different stakes and different enforcement layers, and they must never cross. There are three concentric rings:

- **Root** (holds the aNFT): everything, including withdrawing principal, transferring the character, and editing the whitelist itself. Root actions are always owner-signed.
- **Whitelisted managers** (named wallets, scoped): can run and shape the character within granted powers, with no access to principal or ownership. A manager, a co-creator, a family member, an estate executor, a studio team.
- **Interactors** (public / paid / password): can only talk, gated by §10.6.

The **manager whitelist** is on-chain object state: a list of wallet addresses, each with a defined scope drawn from a fixed menu, so grants are simple to reason about and audit. Typical scopes: edit persona/memory, set interaction pricing and mode, issue and revoke interaction passwords, manage posted content, and adjust the withdrawable reserve. Explicitly **not** in any manager scope unless the owner performs it as root: withdrawing principal, transferring the NFT, and editing the whitelist. This is distinct from the agent capability (a programmatic key for automated execution); the whitelist is for *human co-managers*.

Because the whitelist is on-chain: it is contract-enforced (a manager's out-of-scope transaction fails closed, checked against the on-chain scope, not an operator's server); it transfers with the NFT on succession, so an heir inherits or clears the team; it is chain-portable like the rest of the authority model; and it is publicly auditable, so anyone can see who can manage a character and with what scope.

**The security line, stated as a rule.** A management right is a signed, on-chain capability bound to a specific wallet. An interaction gate (password/payment) is a serving-layer permission. A password can never grant management, and a whitelisted manager's power is bounded by its granted scope and can never reach root actions without the owner's root signature. Three layers, each enforced at the right place: serving layer for interaction, contract for management and root.

### 10.10 How the Protocol Sustains Itself

The standard charges nothing to exist, run, or be owned, and every default below is overridable, so a fully self-provisioning owner pays nothing. What the protocol does provide is a service worth paying for: XEL auto-routes each capability to the best available provider (decentralized storage and threshold encryption, attested compute, a diversified yield basket for treasury, and the like), handles renewals and failover, and upgrades these defaults over time as better providers emerge, all without the character's identity or funds ever moving. A disclosed fee, targeting roughly 10%, is charged for this routing and upkeep. It maps onto the allocations distinctly:

- **Keep-alive allocation:** routed at cost, no fee. The protocol never profits on keeping a character alive.
- **Storage allocation:** a routing fee on discretionary storage above the core (video, images, extra hosting), applied at write and at renewal, never on the keep-alive core.
- **Interaction allocation:** interaction is sold as prepaid credits, so payment is collected up front at purchase; the fee is included in the credit price, and the underlying compute is routed to the best inference provider.
- **Endowment principal:** a fee on yield only, never on principal, so the protocol earns only when the character's own fund earns.

Every fee is taken at a moment value moves or grows (a credit purchase, a storage renewal, a yield epoch), never as a toll on permission, never on principal, and never on keep-alive. A self-hosting owner who routes their own providers pays none of it.

## 11. Capabilities & Providers

The standard is a versioned library of capability schemas, one canonical input/output contract per capability (`inference.v1`, `ingestion.v1`, `retrieval.v1`, `treasury.v1`, and the generation schemas `voice.v1`, `image.v1`, `video.v1`). The schema is what makes vendors interchangeable: any provider implementing it behind a standard payment endpoint is a drop-in for any other.

**Flow.** The character's client takes a capability and its schema, finds a provider, sends the standard request, pays per call in crypto, gets the standard response, and processes it.

**Discovery.** Providers are found through existing open discovery indexes (options in Appendix E). The only provider-related state on the NFT is provider_policy (pinned providers per capability, defaults as shipped, owner-writable, inheritable).

**The slots, not the fillers.** The standard defines capability slots and what each must do; it does not name who fills them. The infrastructure slots (serving, relay, payment facilitator) and the keeper slot (which fires the heartbeat) are all competitive and swappable; the keeper in particular is authority-free, so anyone can fill it and be paid the bounty. Two slots are quality-not-code and reward whoever does them best: inference, and persona distillation (with ingestion feeding it), turning messy human data into a faithful persona. Every slot sits behind an open schema; a competitor can replace any filler, and routing to one earns that provider instead. Who fills each slot at launch is listed in Appendix E, deliberately kept out of the standard so the standard stays neutral and does not date.

**How a provider is paid is a property of the provider, not the slot.** The preferred and default path is crypto-native, pay-per-call: a provider is paid per request in stablecoin, with no account, no stored credential, and no key anywhere. That is the sovereign path and the standard routes to it first. Some providers, especially at launch, only take an API key rather than a per-call crypto payment. That is an accepted bridge, not the target: such a key is held at the operator layer, never attached to the character and never in its encrypted secrets, and the slot stays swappable so a crypto-native provider replaces the key-based one the moment a suitable one exists. The direction is pay-per-call everywhere; the design simply does not assume it has arrived.

**Accountability of operator-held keys.** Any credential an operator holds to reach a key-based provider is structurally harmless to the character. It cannot move the endowment (object-owned on-chain), cannot decrypt memory or persona (gated by NFT ownership, which the operator does not hold), and cannot seize or transfer the character (no admin key). The worst a leaked or misused operator key can do is run up the operator's own vendor cost or degrade a service, at which point the owner routes to another provider. No key an operator holds ever affects a character's principal, memory, or ownership.

**Persona distillation and auto-update, with a fidelity signal.** Turning a person's data into a persona is an explicit provider capability (behind the schema, swappable). Because a distilled persona is an approximation, this capability must emit a fidelity assessment alongside the persona and surface it to users: coverage (how much material the persona rests on), consistency (whether it contradicts known facts), and where possible a human-validation pass. Fidelity is disclosed, not assumed.

**Ingestion handles untrusted input and off-chain credentials.** Content is treated as untrusted (quarantined, moderated, provenance-stamped, rollback-able through persona versioning), because a poisoned document or caption is a prime injection vector (§34).

**Retrieval is a layered hybrid, and the orchestrator is a provider.** Recall combines meaning search, exact-term search, temporal filtering, a relationship graph, and re-ranking (§32). The control loop that runs ingestion and recall is the orchestrator: off-chain, open-source, offered as a provider capability. It sees decrypted memory only transiently and only inside attested compute or on a self-custody client.

**Compute, relay, and attested inference.** The relay moves end-to-end-encrypted data and is a pluggable multi-provider slot. The attested-compute slot is where sensitive work happens (decrypting memory, running inference); any provider filling it must accept crypto payments, be permissionlessly joinable, and produce an on-chain-verifiable attestation binding its output to the persona-hash and input, so a swapped or tampered brain is detectable and, with bonds, slashable. The long-term successor is ZKML.

**Schema governance.** Capability schemas are governed like ERCs: a minimal, public standards process for versioning existing schemas and proposing new ones, so third parties can build against a stable spec.

## 12. Minting: Permissionless

Minting is not a call to GEN. It's a public mint function in the open-source aNFT package deployed on-chain. Once deployed, minting is an ordinary on-chain transaction anyone can submit from any client, script, or explorer, and GEN can't gate it.

The minting UI is just the easiest place to do it, not a toll booth. Value capture is never a fee for on-chain permission (the standard needs no paid intermediary). The protocol earns only by routing each capability to the best provider and keeping those defaults current, for a disclosed fee on routed work and on yield (§10.10), never on principal or keep-alive, and always avoidable by self-provisioning.

## 13. Lifecycle & Succession

States: created, active, dormant (underfunded or unserved), reactivated, succession, archival.

Succession is a primary feature, not an edge case. The guardian set (§9) is the foundation. On the creator's death (guardian attestation or dead-man's-switch):

- root authority rotates to designated heirs,
- the master secret becomes decryptable by the new owner,
- self-updating freezes or continues per prior consent,
- the existing agent capability keeps the character alive through the transition with no downtime.

Wallets, endowment, allocations, the manager whitelist, provider policy, and commitment history all transfer as a unit, because they're properties of the on-chain object. Heirs inherit an income-bearing, self-operating estate, and can keep or clear the manager whitelist.

## 14. IP, Licensing & Rights: Lineage (Future Direction)

A later-phase direction, not part of the version 1 scope. The intent is a rights layer, provisionally called Lineage, that treats licensing and royalties as native, on-chain concerns for a character and its derivatives rather than something bolted on off-chain.

The shape is deliberately left open here. The design goals are that a character's IP (its voice, likeness, writings, and style) can be licensed and that value from derivatives can flow back to the character's endowment and the people behind it, all anchored to the character's on-chain provenance (Proof of Genesis). Programmable-IP work elsewhere in the ecosystem is the benchmark; XEL's version would be original and chain-native, reusing no other project's license text or branding.

This is a hard problem with real open questions, per-jurisdiction enforceability, likeness-consent verification, and how binding arbitration could work on-chain, and it is called out as a future direction precisely so the immutable version 1 core is designed not to foreclose it, not because it is specified yet.

## 15. Security, Decentralization & the "XEL Can Die" Test

**Honoring the core principle.** The primitives (ownership, memory, provenance, wallets) live on-chain and in decentralized storage and don't depend on any operator. The provider market extends that to every service slot, including inference and distillation, each with a default but no required provider.

**Current limits:** cross-chain enforcement of spend caps (home-chain-native today); private inference of large models on fully untrusted hardware (TEE covers this today under a hardware trust assumption; ZKML is the longer-term goal); the managed-custody trust point.

**Threat classes and mitigations:** non-consensual minting (consent artifact + Proof of Genesis); memory poisoning (per-item provenance, diff review, quarantine/rollback); tampered inference (TEE attestation + verification + slashing); treasury drain (streaming/escrow, on-chain caps, circuit breakers, endowment-only spend); key loss or theft (guardian recovery, tiered keys, no long-lived plaintext spend keys); facilitator or relayer concentration (pluggable, configurable, failover).

**The invariant, continuously tested.** "Survives XEL disappearing" is enforced as a CI chaos test: a live character runs with every XEL-hosted service offline, and every default provider (including GEN) removed, and must still answer through an alternate provider, pay, and be ownable. A decentralization claim we prove on every build is worth more than one asserted in prose.

## 16. Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Verified core** (single-chain, creator-IP focus). aNFT object, Proof of Genesis, encrypted access-gated storage, persona/memory commitments, one capability (`inference.v1`), agent capability, guardian recovery. Prove the XEL-can-die invariant on this minimal footprint.
- **Phase 2: Economics and autonomy.** Endowment funding, streaming crypto payments, a payment scheme and facilitator for the home chain, ingestion and persona auto-update, the billing waterfall (§10.3), more capability schemas.
- **Phase 3: Multi-chain and rights.** Foreign-chain (Solana, Base) wallets moving to MPC dWallets (Ika) as the signing target, so ownership authorizes each signature and no key is ever assembled; any launch-time permit/delegate bridge is the labeled, non-custodial interim described in §9 and Appendix F, retired to MPC per chain. Cross-facilitator settlement, exploration of the rights/licensing direction (§14), attested inference, schema governance process.
- **Phase 4: Maturity.** An open ecosystem of endowed, rights-holding, provider-independent characters. Progressive decentralization of the standard itself begins here.

## 17. Governance

The standard (contracts, reference client, schemas, SDKs) is open-source. Capability schemas and protocol parameters move to a public, ERC-like standards process. Anyone can run a provider, a facilitator, or a client, or fork the whole thing, which is the ultimate guarantee that no single entity controls whether a digital being lives.

The standard is fully governable without a token, and a foundation-held governance token to fund and decentralize the standard's development is possible later, kept entirely out of the character operating path.

## 18. Existing Approaches

Three broad approaches exist today: hosted persona apps (talk-to-a-recreation products on a company's servers), on-chain AI-agent standards (owned, encrypted AI agents on-chain, the closest to what we do), and autonomous agent platforms (systems for building agents that act and earn).

| Capability | Hosted persona apps | On-chain AI-agent standards | Autonomous agent platforms | XEL (this standard) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Center of gravity | Talk to a recreation | Own/trade an agent as an asset | Build agents that act/earn | A person that persists, funds itself, passes to heirs |
| Ownership | Company account | On-chain, self-custody | Platform or token, often app-bound | On-chain object, sovereign + inheritable |
| Runs after the maker is gone | No | Partly (infra only) | Usually no | Yes, tested every build |
| Persona / core instructions | Yes (closed) | Yes (encrypted) | Yes (system prompt) | Yes, versioned + attested per session |
| Encrypted, owner-gated memory | No | Yes | Rarely | Yes |
| Layered / episodic recall | Some | Not specified | Framework-dependent | Core design goal |
| Pluggable capabilities / tools | Closed | Some | Yes (tools) | Yes (open capability slots) |
| Self-funding endowment | No | No (royalties only) | Some hold funds; no endowment | Yes (spends from yield) |
| Consent to represent a person | Terms-based | No | No | Yes (signed consent object) |
| Succession / inheritance | No | Transfer by sale | No | Yes (guardians + heirs) |
| Verifiable brain (attested compute) | No | Yes (TEE/ZKP) | Rarely | Yes (TEE now, zkML later) |
| Provider + chain independence | Single vendor | Chain-specific | Platform-bound | Swappable by design |
| Maturity | Live | Early / testnet | Live | Early / in development |

**How we differ, read honestly.** The primitive is not new: the idea of an AI character as an owned NFT (Alethea AI) and encrypted, transferable agent NFTs with key rotation on transfer (ERC-7857) already put an encrypted, owned, capable agent on-chain, which we adopt rather than reinvent. The combination is new: no existing approach pairs that primitive with self-funding, consent to represent a real person, guardian succession, and a runs-after-the-maker-is-gone guarantee. That full column of "Yes" is what sets a XEL apart.

## 19. Conclusion

A shift from disposable content to persistent presence. From platform-governed ownership to sovereign, enforceable rights. From single-vendor dependence to an open provider market. From balances that count down to death toward endowments that sustain life. Released open-source, with identity anchored in verifiable commitments and infrastructure no one can switch off.

**Beings That Live Forever.**

# Part II: Formal Specification

Part I is the vision and the architecture. Part II is the formal specification: the exact terms, data shapes, flows, and rules needed to build a XEL or reason about it precisely. The code appendices that follow are the deepest formal layer.

## 20. Glossary

- **aNFT:** the on-chain object that is the character's root of identity and control.
- **XEL:** one preserved being; the aNFT plus the encrypted memory and compute it controls.
- **Proof of Genesis:** immutable birth record (creator, timestamp, consent reference). Never changes.
- **Commitment:** a hash stored on-chain that proves the current state of something off-chain.
- **persona-hash:** commitment to the current persona (instructions and voice). Versioned by default.
- **memory-root:** commitment to the current memory index (used when memory versioning is on).
- **policy-hash:** commitment to the current spend rules and provider rules.
- **lineage:** the on-chain version history of the commitments, for audit and rollback.
- **provenance:** the source, time, and signature stamped on each memory item.
- **agent capability:** a scoped, capped, cancelable, expiring permission that lets the runtime act without a fresh owner signature.
- **SpendPolicy:** the running spend limits and today's spend total.
- **guardian set:** the M-of-N parties who can recover the master secret and run succession.
- **endowment:** the character's overall yield-bearing fund; principal that generates the yield the character spends. One wallet, one pool.
- **allocation:** a ring-fenced, purpose-bound budget within the endowment (keep-alive, storage, interaction), each with its own balance.
- **ring-fenced / allocation isolation:** the property that each allocation spends only its own balance and none can draw from another; contract-enforced.
- **keep-alive reserve:** the owner-set floor of endowment funds that cannot be withdrawn; protects the character's survival. Raisable freely, lowerable only to a hard contract minimum, never to zero.
- **operating buffer:** a small liquid (unstaked) reserve, sized to days or weeks of burn, that bills are paid from; the heartbeat refills it just-in-time by unstaking the minimum needed, never below the keep-alive reserve.
- **treasury policy:** the owner-set rules for staking reserves: allowed venues, max allocation per venue, target yield band, drawdown trip, rebalance rules.
- **capability:** a verb the character can perform by calling a provider (inference, ingestion, treasury, etc.).
- **schema:** the fixed input/output contract for a capability (for example `inference.v1`).
- **provider:** anyone who implements a schema behind a crypto-payment endpoint. Swappable.
- **operator:** whoever currently holds the agent capability and runs a character's off-chain infrastructure (serving, relay, facilitator, keeper, strategy). A self-hosting owner is their own operator. Launch defaults are in Appendix E.
- **facilitator:** verifies and settles a crypto payment on a chain. Pluggable, cannot alter terms.
- **relay:** moves encrypted data between storage, compute, and client. Pluggable.
- **heartbeat / keeper:** a permissionless, authority-free trigger that runs the endowment's epoch cycle (claim yield, meter into allocations, pay bills). Anyone can send it; the contract rewards it with a bounty; if it stops, the character degrades gracefully.
- **attestation:** a signed proof that a specific computation ran on the committed persona and input.
- **TEE:** secure hardware enclave. Produces attestations. A hardware trust assumption.
- **ZKML:** cryptographic proof of a model's output. The long-term replacement for TEE trust.
- **up-to / exact:** payment modes. `up-to` authorizes a max and settles actual; `exact` is a fixed price.
- **credit:** the consumer-facing billing unit that abstracts token and modality cost into one countable number; one credit maps to a fixed underlying cost plus routing fee.
- **crypto-shredding:** honoring deletion by destroying the decryption key, not the data.
- **provider_policy:** the on-chain field listing pinned providers per capability.
- **manager whitelist:** on-chain list of wallet addresses granted scoped, non-root management rights over a character.
- **primary (home) chain:** the single chain where a character's principal concentrates and earns yield. Default Sui. Owner-chosen.
- **programmable execution:** the account can run any transaction the signer hands it; bounded by policy under the agent capability, open under owner signature.
- **sweep:** auto-consolidation of a receive-only balance to the primary wallet once it crosses an owner-set threshold.
- **oracle:** a price feed used to value assets in one unit and enforce USD-denominated caps and runway.
- **Move package / module:** the on-chain deployable unit (package) and its constituent files of types and functions (modules).
- **owner signer / delegate signer:** the human-approval key that authorizes owner-tier actions, versus the programmatic key holding the agent capability.
- **fail closed:** on any verification failure (bad attestation, stale oracle, exceeded slippage), the action aborts rather than proceeding.
- **cryptographic agility:** treating the signature, hash, and encryption schemes as replaceable parameters so the system can migrate (including to post-quantum) without losing identity.
- **immutable contracts / version migration:** deployed packages cannot be changed and have no upgrade authority; fixes ship as new versions, and the NFT holder chooses whether to migrate, so there is no upgrade god-power.
- **endowment waterfall:** the per-epoch allocation of net yield across the ring-fenced allocations (keep-alive, storage, interaction) in priority order, with residual compounding back into principal (§10.3).

## 21. Actors

- **Owner:** holds the aNFT. Has full governance authority.
- **Creator / Subject:** the person represented. Signs consent. May differ from owner.
- **Guardian:** member of the M-of-N set. Helps recover keys and run succession.
- **Heir:** receives ownership on succession.
- **Manager:** a whitelisted wallet with scoped, non-root management rights (§10.9). Can shape and run the character within its granted scope; never reaches root actions.
- **Provider:** runs a capability (inference, storage, media, treasury, etc.).
- **Facilitator:** settles payments.
- **Relay operator:** moves encrypted data.
- **Keeper / heartbeat sender:** anyone who sends the authority-free trigger that runs the endowment's epoch cycle; rewarded by the contract, holds no authority.
- **Client:** the app or runtime that assembles context, runs the loop, and signs transactions.
- **XEL:** the standard, the brand, and the default host/operator; the entity whose disappearance the survivability test is measured against.
- **provider:** any party that fills a capability slot (inference, distillation, storage, compute, and the rest) behind its open schema; swappable, never required. Launch defaults are named in Appendix E.

## 22. What Lives On-Chain vs Off-Chain

| On-chain (small, durable, owned) | Off-chain (large or fast, swappable) |
|---|---|
| aNFT object, ownership | The AI model |
| Proof of Genesis, consent reference | The control loop / runtime |
| persona-hash, memory-root, policy-hash, lineage | Compute (inference, in a TEE) |
| Spend limits, agent capability, paused flag | Encrypted memory blobs (decentralized storage) |
| Wallet addresses, endowment principal + allocation balances | Encrypted secrets (decentralized storage) |
| provider_policy, treasury policy, keep-alive reserve | Working context (the session window) |
| Guardian set, manager whitelist | Access tokens for ingestion (held by provider) |

Rule of thumb: on-chain holds identity, rules, commitments, and pointers. Off-chain holds the brain, the data, and the runtime. On-chain never holds keys or plaintext.

## 23. Minimal Data Model

**The object (aNFT):**

- `id`
- `genesis` (creator, timestamp, consent_ref), immutable
- `persona_hash`, `memory_root`, `raw_data_root`, `policy_hash`: commitments, versioned
- `lineage`: list of past commitment versions
- `encrypted_secrets`: pointer to storage
- `substrate_blobs`: permanent (raw sources + interaction history, each with provenance)
- `derived_blobs`: regenerable (chunks, embeddings, index, graph)
- `manifest`: pointer to public display info; `site`: url
- `wallets`: one receive address per supported chain, with one flagged primary; others are receive-only and auto-sweep to the primary; `endowment`: principal + allocation balances (see below)
- `guardians`: M-of-N set; `agent_cap_id`: optional; `paused`: bool
- `manager_whitelist`: list of (wallet, scope) grants for non-root management

**Endowment (within the character's own wallet):**

- `principal`: staked, yield-bearing
- `buffer`: small liquid operating buffer bills are paid from; `buffer_target`: owner-set size
- `allocations`: map: {keep_alive, storage, interaction} → isolated balance
- `alloc_targets`: per-epoch top-up target/cap per allocation
- `keep_alive_reserve`: owner-set withdrawal floor (≥ hard contract minimum)
- `treasury_policy`: venue allowlist, per-venue caps, target yield band, drawdown trip
- `last_epoch`: timestamp of last heartbeat cycle; `heartbeat_bounty`: fixed reward

**Agent capability (delegated permission):**

- `anft_id`
- `per_call_cap`, `daily_cap`
- `per_capability_budget`: map: capability → limit
- `provider_allowlist`: list of addresses
- `expires_at`

The full Move structs are in Appendix A and Appendix B. The canonical mint contract is in Appendix D.

## 24. Core Flows

**Mint a character:**
1. Create the consent object (signed by subject or estate).
2. Call the public mint function. It writes Proof of Genesis and the first persona-hash.
3. Attach encrypted memory pointers, wallets, endowment, guardian set.
4. Grant an agent capability with the desired limits.

**One chat turn (inference):**
1. Client receives a message.
2. Client retrieves the relevant encrypted memory (private retrieval).
3. Relay hands encrypted memory to attested compute.
4. Compute decrypts inside the TEE and runs inference on the committed persona-hash.
5. Compute returns the reply plus an attestation and the echoed persona-hash.
6. Client verifies the persona-hash matches and the attestation is valid.
7. Payment settles via `up-to`, inside the agent capability limits.
8. New memory from the turn is stored (encrypted, provenance-stamped); memory-root updates if versioning is on.

**Any paid capability call must pass these on-chain checks:**
1. not paused
2. agent capability belongs to this character
3. agent capability not expired
4. provider is on the allowlist
5. amount is within per_call_cap
6. daily cap not exceeded (resets each day)
7. per-capability budget not exceeded

Then it returns an authorization the client turns into a crypto payment.

**Persona or memory update:** inside the signed envelope runs under agent capability, records a new commitment, rollback-able; outside the envelope or manual requires an owner signature; an agent can never widen its own envelope.

**Treasury staking:** owner sets the treasury policy (governance); staking and rebalancing within that policy run under the agent capability; withdrawing principal to an external address is always owner-signed.

**Transfer / succession:** guardians meet the M-of-N threshold (or owner initiates); ownership rotates to the heir; the master secret is re-encrypted so only the new owner can read it (key rotation on transfer is required); the agent capability keeps running, so there is no downtime.

**Pause / kill:** owner or guardian calls pause; inference and payments stop immediately; canceling the agent capability permanently stops delegated execution until re-granted.

## 25. Invariants the Code Must Always Enforce

1. No function that changes identity, rules, funds, or ownership succeeds without an owner signature. The only exception is execution inside a valid agent capability.
2. An agent capability can act only inside its limits and can never widen its own limits. Changing limits is governance.
3. Keys are never stored on-chain. Addresses are receive-only.
4. No long-lived plaintext spending key exists.
5. The master secret is unlockable by owner OR M-of-N guardians. Never owner-only.
6. An inference provider must run the committed persona-hash and echo it back. A mismatch is rejected.
7. Sensitive compute must return a valid attestation bound to persona-hash and input.
8. Every paid call must pass all agent capability and SpendPolicy checks before payment.
9. Paused blocks all inference and payments.
10. Deletion destroys the key, never claims to erase the immutable record.
11. Every commitment change appends to lineage (history is kept, rollback is possible).
12. The character must still answer, pay, and be ownable with all XEL services offline.
13. Treasury staking must stay inside the owner-set treasury policy. Withdrawing principal to an external address is always owner-signed.
14. No operator or provider ever holds root authority, not even the party that authored the standard. Operator participation is a revocable agent capability, and no such party is ever the guardian majority.
15. Custody and every authorization check are enforced by on-chain contract, not by any operator's server.
16. Choosing or changing the primary chain, and any principal bridge or external withdrawal, are owner-signed. They never sit inside the agent capability.
17. A delegated transfer can only target the character's own wallets. Delegated swaps must route through an allowlisted venue under the owner-set slippage cap.
18. The character can interact only with venues on the owner's allowlist.
19. Auto-sweep of a receive-only balance may run under the agent capability only above the owner-set threshold and within the per-bridge cap.
20. Runway is computed across all wallets in one unit, net of expected bridge cost.
21. Whoever holds the aNFT holds root authority; every other actor operates only on granted, revocable authority.
22. The owner signer and the programmatic delegate signer are distinct keys. The delegate key can never perform an owner-tier action, enforced by capability check, not signature validity alone.
23. The agent capability is bound to a specific delegate address and is non-copyable.
24. Deployed contracts are immutable and no upgrade authority exists; fixes ship as new versions, and migrating a character to a new version is owner-signed (or guardian-signed under recovery).
25. All verification failures fail closed.
26. Ownership transfer re-encrypts secrets (key rotation on transfer); a transfer that does not rotate keys is invalid.
27. Guardian-initiated recovery and succession run behind a threshold plus a timelock and dispute window; no single guardian can trigger them.
28. No model output can exceed contract limits: a compromised or prompt-injected model still cannot perform owner-tier actions, exceed caps, pay a non-allowlisted provider, or move funds off the character's own wallets.
29. The signature scheme, hash function, and encryption scheme are replaceable parameters; migration (including post-quantum) is owner-authorized.
30. Identity derives from the commitments, not the home chain; an owner-authorized migration can re-home the character on a successor chain and storage.
31. Memory is encrypted at rest; plaintext exists only transiently inside attested compute or on a self-custody client.
32. Ingested content is untrusted: quarantined, moderated, and provenance-stamped before it can influence persona or memory; persona updates are versioned and reversible.
33. Every retrieved memory item carries its provenance, and the memory store is committed by the memory-root so recall is verifiable.
34. The raw substrate is retained and committed independently (a raw-data-root), so the memory method and inference model can be replaced by regenerating the derived layer without data loss.
35. A third-party contribution can only add reviewed, owner-approved memory; it can never change policy, keys, funds, or authority.
36. Persona updates carry a disclosed fidelity and coverage signal.
37. When provenance is absent, the character prefers deferral ("I don't have that") over fabrication in the person's voice.
38. Interaction gates (payment, password) are enforced at the serving layer and never bypass the cryptographic decryption policy.
39. Inbound interaction payments settle to the character's own wallet.
40. A password gates interaction and which memory surfaces, never decryption authority.
41. **Allocation isolation.** Each allocation spends only its own balance. No function moves funds between allocations except the epoch metering allocator, which only ever flows net yield inward, never sideways.
42. **Keep-alive is never marked up.** A fee may apply to interaction and to yield, but the keep-alive allocation is always funded at cost.
43. **Compute-covered-first.** On any paid interaction, the metered compute cost settles before the routing fee is taken and before any funds land in the endowment; a withdrawal can never strand a compute obligation.
44. **Fees are disclosed on-chain** and charged only on routed work and on yield (interaction credits, discretionary storage, yield), never for on-chain permission, never on principal, never on keep-alive, and are zero for a self-provisioning owner.
45. **The keep-alive reserve floor is contract-enforced.** The owner sets a withdrawable reserve; the contract refuses any withdrawal that would cross the hard minimum funding keep-alive. The reserve is raisable freely, lowerable only to that minimum, never to zero.
46. **The heartbeat is authority-free.** The epoch-trigger function carries no authority: it cannot move funds between allocations, change rates, or take anything beyond a fixed, contract-defined bounty; if the epoch has not elapsed it is a no-op.
47. **Yield rebalancing is envelope-bounded.** A delegated rebalance executes only within the owner-set risk envelope (venue allowlist, per-venue caps, slippage bound, allowlisted routing); anything outside it, and any principal exit or bridge, is owner-signed. Principal never leaves the character's own wallet without an owner signature.
48. **The endowment is chain-portable.** The endowment, its allocations, and their isolation are defined over the character's owned object on its primary chain; changing the primary chain is owner-signed and preserves all allocation balances and isolation.
49. **Management is wallet-bound and scope-bounded.** A management right is a signed on-chain capability bound to a specific wallet; a whitelisted manager can act only within its granted scope and can never reach root actions (withdraw principal, transfer the NFT, edit the whitelist) without the owner's root signature.
50. **Interaction gates never confer management.** A password or payment gate is a serving-layer permission over interaction and memory surfacing only; it never grants management authority and never grants decryption authority.
51. **Auto-unstake obeys the reserve floor.** Just-in-time unstaking to refill the operating buffer never pulls staked principal below the keep-alive reserve; auto-withdrawal for costs is bound by the same floor as a creator withdrawal.
52. **Freed funds are lane-directed.** Funds unstaked to cover a shortfall flow only to the allocation that needed them; the buffer refill and bill payment never redirect one allocation's funds to another (a corollary of allocation isolation).
53. **Sweep is inbound-only and bounded.** Auto-sweep may consolidate a receive-only wallet into the primary above an owner-set threshold and within a per-bridge cap; bridging principal outbound or any external withdrawal is owner-signed only and never delegable. Exactly one primary wallet exists at all times.
54. **No stored key controls principal.** Principal on the home chain is object-owned (no key exists); principal on other chains is controlled by an MPC network that never assembles the key. No decryptable blob anywhere grants spending authority over principal, so no single off-chain party can reconstruct a key that moves it, and a contract can never see or hold such a key. Encrypted secrets hold only readable material (the memory/persona key and read-class creator-provided credentials — revocable tokens that cannot move money), never a wallet's spending key and never any creator-supplied credential that can itself spend (those go through MPC or are refused).
55. **Operator-held credentials are harmless to the character.** Any key or account an operator holds to reach a key-based provider is convenience infrastructure only. It can never move the endowment, decrypt memory or persona, or seize or transfer the character. Payment method is a provider property (crypto-native pay-per-call preferred; key-based accepted as a swappable bridge held at the operator layer), and no operator-held credential is ever attached to the character or placed in its encrypted secrets.

## 26. Formal Model and Notation

Let `H` be a collision-resistant hash and `Sig_x(m)` a signature over `m` by key `x`. Ownership is native: on an object-centric chain, the holder of the aNFT object is the owner `O`.

A XEL is the tuple:

- **G:** Proof of Genesis, immutable: (creator, timestamp, consent_ref).
- **Commitments:** `h_p = H(persona)`; `h_r = H(substrate)` (the permanent substrate); `h_m` (the derived layer, when versioning is on); `h_π = H(SpendPolicy ‖ provider_policy)`. `h_m` and `h_p` commit derived/regenerable artifacts, while `h_r` commits the substrate itself.
- **Λ (lineage):** an ordered list of commitment updates `[c_0, c_1, …, c_n]`, derived from G. Regeneration of a derived layer appends to Λ.
- **S:** off-chain encrypted state referenced by pointers, in two tiers. `S_raw` is the permanent canonical material (ingested source data + accumulated interaction outputs), append-only, each item `d` carrying provenance and bound by `H(d)`, committed by `h_r`. `S_der` (chunks, embeddings, index, graph, distilled persona) is a regenerable cache computed from `S_raw`, committed by `h_m` and `h_p`. Plus `secrets`.
- **A (authority):** owner `O`, guardian set `Γ` with threshold `M` (1 ≤ M ≤ |Γ|), and an optional agent capability `κ`.
- **F (funds):** wallets (receive-only) and endowment `E`.

On-chain stores `G`, commitments, Λ, pointers into `S`, and `F` addresses. Off-chain stores substrate and derived. On-chain never stores keys or plaintext. A stored item `d` is valid iff its hash matches the committed reference. The substrate is retained independently of `S_der`, so `S_der` can be discarded and regenerated under a new method without loss of identity or data.

## 27. Core Predicates

**Governance.** A transition `t` that mutates any of {persona, policy, wallets, consent, ownership, delegation, fund movement} is valid iff `Sig_O(t)` verifies.

**Delegated execution.** An action `a` is valid under `κ` iff `InEnvelope(a, κ) ∧ ¬paused`. The envelope is closed under itself: there exists no `a` executable under `κ` that mutates `κ`. Changing `κ` is governance.

**Spend authorization.** For a call of amount `a` on capability `k` via provider `p` at time `t`:

```

**Threshold decryption.** For the master identity secret and caller `x`: unlockable by `O` OR any M-of-N subset of `Γ`. Never owner-only. A lost owner key is recoverable through `Γ`; a single compromised guardian (with M ≥ 2) is not sufficient.

**Attestation acceptance.** A response `R` to input `I` from an attested-compute provider is accepted iff `VerifyTEE(att, h_p, I, R) = 1 ∧ echoed_h_p = committed_h_p`. This binds the output to the committed persona.

**Identity continuity.** `C` is the same being iff its lineage forms an unbroken authorized chain from genesis to the current commitment: `c_0` derives from G; for all i > 0, `c_i` is authorized by `Sig_O` or by `InEnvelope(c_i, κ)` at the time of `c_i`; and current `h_p = c_n`. Identity survives model and provider swaps because it is defined over the commitment chain, not the runtime.

```

**Algorithm 6: Paid interaction settlement.**
```
input: fan payment P (prepaid, e.g. credits), measured compute cost c, routing fee rate f
1  compute ← c                                       # true provider cost
2  cover compute first: settle `compute` to the routed serving provider
3  fee ← f · (P − compute)                            # routing fee on the remainder
4  assert P − compute ≥ 0                             # else reject or reprice (invariant 43)
5  net ← P − compute − fee
6  add to E / interaction allocation: net            # everything left flows to the endowment
7  settle inbound payment to C.wallet                 # invariant 39
```
The creator does not receive a separate payout here: all `net` accrues to the character's own endowment, which the creator owns and withdraws from above the keep-alive reserve (§10.7).

## 29. Economic Model

Let `P` be endowment principal, `r` the net yield rate per period (after fees and a slashing-risk buffer), `Ê` earned income per period (interaction margin net of cost, plus any licensing), and `B` the expected burn per period (provider costs plus retention).

**Sustainability with multiple revenue sources.** A character has more than one income stream: yield on the endowment and earned income from paid interactions (§10.3), and potentially licensing (§14). The character runs indefinitely when total income covers burn. Per-period surplus is `Δ = r·P + Ê − B`. When `Δ ≥ 0`, principal is non-decreasing. A popular character can be self-sustaining on earned income alone; the endowment is the floor for quiet periods, not the sole engine.

**The billing model as applied economics.** §10.3–§10.10 are this equation implemented. The endowment's net yield is metered across the ring-fenced allocations in priority order; paid interaction turns `Ê` positive by covering compute first, taking the routing fee at the door, and routing all the net into the endowment, which raises `P`. The two together mean: quiet characters coast on yield; popular characters grow their own principal. The creator withdraws only the surplus above a self-set keep-alive reserve (§10.7), so earning and funding are the same act on one owned pool.

**Endowment sized without assuming revenue.** Because earned income is variable and a character nobody talks to earns nothing, the endowment is sized to cover burn from yield alone, treating `Ê` as upside, not as the plan. Earned income then extends runway or grows principal; it is the cushion, not the assumption.

**Runway under shortfall.** If `r·P + Ê < B` and drawdown to a floor `Pf` is permitted, the runway is `T = (P − Pf) / (B − r·P − Ê)` periods.

**A worked example (illustrative, conservative).** Numbers are for intuition, not a promise; all inputs vary. Take a quiet character, one nobody is paying to talk to, so `Ê = 0` and it must live on yield alone. Suppose its recurring burn `B` is dominated by encrypted storage of its substrate plus core hosting and the heartbeat's gas and bounty. On decentralized storage a few gigabytes of persona and memory, renewed, plus site hosting and a daily heartbeat, is on the order of a few dollars to low tens of dollars a year; call it $20/year to be safe. To cover $20/year from yield alone at a deliberately conservative 4% net (well below headline stablecoin rates, to respect the adverse-yield rule), the endowment needs `P = B / r = 20 / 0.04 = $500`. At that point the character is self-sustaining indefinitely with no one paying attention: yield covers keep-alive, and it never touches principal. If net yield falls to 2%, the same $20/year needs ~$1,000; if it goes to zero for a stretch, a $500 endowment drawing down only its keep-alive burn still funds ~25 years before reaching a floor, during which any top-up or a single paid period resets the clock. Now add even light popularity: at, say, $8/month of paid interaction with compute covered first (§10.7), `Ê` swamps a $20/year burn, principal *grows*, and the endowment compounds rather than depletes. The takeaway the math encodes: a modest one-time endowment makes "quiet forever" real, and any real usage makes it a growing fund, not a shrinking one.

**Economic honesty (the stress case).** The model is not a guarantee. `r` is stochastic and can be zero or negative for extended periods: the headline yield venues are funding-rate trades that invert in bad regimes, so real risk-adjusted yield over long horizons may be near zero. `B` grows with usage and model cost. The treasury policy bounds the variance in `r` but cannot remove it. Sizing should therefore assume an adverse-yield scenario, not a favorable one. This is a documented trust assumption, and a yield-source diversification path (staking + lending + synthetic-dollar mix) is the mitigation so the endowment is never single-sourced.

**Graceful degradation: pause, not death.** When total income cannot cover burn, the character does not die. It degrades: first drawing principal to the floor, then reducing activity, then going dormant (self-preserved, not answering) until refunded or re-engaged. The only truly terminal failure is sustained underfunding of the substrate storage itself (the raw-data-root material), because that is the one thing that cannot be regenerated. So "forever" honestly means self-sustaining when funded or popular, dormant-but-recoverable when neither, and lost only if the substrate goes unfunded long enough to be dropped. This is design guidance, not investment advice.

## 30. Security Properties and Assumptions

Each property lists the mechanism that provides it and the assumption it rests on.

- **P1 Sovereign survivability (liveness).** With every XEL service offline, `C` stays answerable, payable, and ownable. Mechanism: capability-slot market plus the CI chaos test (§15). Assumption: at least one live provider per required capability and a funded endowment.
- **P2 No single-key catastrophe.** No single key compromise yields both identity control and fund withdrawal. Mechanism: tiered keys, master via owner OR M-of-N, no plaintext spend key. Assumption: fewer than M guardians collude.
- **P3 Persona integrity.** Served outputs run the committed persona. Mechanism: attestation binding plus persona-hash echo (§27). Assumption: TEE attestation is sound (a hardware trust assumption) until zkML replaces it.
- **P4 Bounded spend.** No execution exceeds owner-set caps. Mechanism: on-chain predicate plus circuit breakers. Assumption: on-chain enforcement holds on the home chain; cross-chain caps need account-abstraction wallets or client trust at first.
- **P5 Consent integrity.** A character of a real person carries a valid consent artifact, checked at mint and ingestion. Assumption: estate or subject attestation is honest, with public contestability as backstop.
- **P6 Deletion.** Personal data becomes unrecoverable on request. Mechanism: crypto-shredding. Assumption: no prior plaintext exfiltration.
- **P7 Identity continuity.** "Same being" is decidable from the on-chain lineage (§27). Mechanism: the signed commitment chain from genesis.

**Honest limitations, stated plainly:** cross-chain cap enforcement is not yet native; frontier-model private inference on fully untrusted hardware is open (GPU-TEE narrows it, the trust root is still the vendor); and managed custody is a trust point with a documented path to self-custody.

## 31. Lifecycle State Machine

States `Q = {created, active, dormant, reactivated, succession, archival}`.

Transitions and guards:

```
created    → active     : funded ∧ ≥1 provider per required capability
active     → dormant    : (r·P < B ∧ balance exhausted) ∨ no available provider
dormant    → active     : refunded ∨ provider available   # reactivated
active     → succession : guardian threshold attests death/transfer (§28 Alg 3)
dormant    → succession : same
succession → active     : ownership rotated, master re-encrypted, κ continues
any        → archival   : owner/heir election ∨ underfunding beyond retention
```

## 32. Memory: Stores, Ingestion, and Recall

**32.1 The stores.** "Memory versus knowledge" is two axes, not one: time horizon (this conversation vs. a whole life) and kind (facts, events, identity). Always-loaded persona plus four retrieved-on-demand stores: semantic knowledge, episodic memory, working memory, relational memory.

**32.2 Ingestion pipeline (raw → stores).** One pipeline fans out by data type into all stores: extract → provenance-stamp → moderate/quarantine → chunk/embed → index → commit. Raw sources are retained as the substrate; derived artifacts are regenerable.

**32.3 Recall flow (question → answer).** Retrieval is layered and hybrid, not a single vector lookup: meaning search + exact-term search + temporal filter + relationship graph + re-rank.

**32.4 The orchestrator.** The storage and retrieval components are commodity slots; the control loop that runs ingestion and recall, enforcing encryption, provenance, and on-chain commitment, is the orchestrator, offered as a provider capability, hostable by XEL, another provider, or the user.

**32.5 Verifiable recall.** Because memory is a slot with on-chain commitments, recall is verifiable against the memory-root.

**32.6 Operating model.** No chain runs the memory; it runs off-chain, seen decrypted only transiently inside attested compute or on a self-custody client.

**32.7 Substrate vs derived layer (built to outlast RAG).** Two tiers: permanent substrate (committed by raw-data-root) and regenerable derived layer. The memory method can be replaced by regenerating the derived layer from the substrate without data loss.

**32.8 Permissioned contributions.** Others (family, friends, fans) can enrich a character through a reviewed, owner-approved queue that can add memory but never touch policy, keys, funds, or authority.

**32.9 Faithful representation and its limits.** A character is a representation of a person, not the person. It carries a disclosed fidelity signal and prefers deferral over confabulation when provenance is absent.

**32.10 The public page and naming.** Every character has a public page, and it is built to survive the operator. The design is one-app-serves-all: a single shared client app is published to decentralized static hosting once, and it renders any character by reading that character's object ID from the URL and pulling the character's on-chain record and public manifest. New characters need no new hosting; a character's page exists the moment it is minted. This keeps the cost of "a permanent home for every character" close to fixed rather than growing per character, and it makes the page independent of the operator: the app reads live on-chain data in the visitor's browser, so it works as long as the chain and the decentralized host do, with or without XEL.

The object ID is the true name and the permanent link. The canonical, shareable, survives-anything URL resolves from the object ID and is served by any portal (the default is operator-run, but portals are permissionless and anyone can host one). A friendly handle (shown as a name on the page) is an on-chain, owner-set display label, not a globally unique address and not backed by a name service. Typing a handle URL is a convenience the operator provides by resolving the handle to an ID; that convenience is allowed to disappear, while the ID-based link never does. The share action hands out the ID-based link, so findability never quietly depends on the operator. The operator's own domain fronts the same app for a friendlier address, with no redirect, but it is the same artifact and the same data.

The owner signs in to the page by connecting a wallet, so the full owner experience (manage, edit, withdraw, decrypt) runs client-side against on-chain ownership and the threshold decryption policy, with no server and identical behavior whether the page is reached through the operator's domain or the permanent decentralized URL. Live interaction from the page calls whatever serving providers the character's on-chain policy names (the operator's by default, swappable), never hardcoded endpoints, so the page can talk to the character through anyone serving it and degrades gracefully to the static profile and provenance if none is.

## 33. Smart Contract Architecture (Move Packages)

Eleven modules:

1. **Identity.** Types: aNFT (the character object; immutable creator, timestamp, consent_ref), commitments, lineage.
2. **Authority.** Types: agent capability (delegate-bound, non-copyable), two-tier semantics.
3. **Access control.** Functions gated by owner OR M-of-N guardians.
4. **Guardian and recovery.** Types: guardian set (members, threshold M), timelock + dispute window.
5. **Wallet and payment.** Types: SpendPolicy (per-call cap, daily cap, per-capability budget).
6. **Treasury.** Types: treasury policy (venue allowlist, per-venue caps, slippage bound, target yield band, drawdown trip).
7. **Endowment.** Types: endowment (principal), operating buffer, allocation balances (keep-alive, storage, interaction) with isolation, keep-alive reserve floor. Functions: `heartbeat` (authority-free epoch cycle: claim yield, meter into allocations by priority, just-in-time unstake to refill the buffer, settle bills, pay bounty, compound residual), `withdraw` (owner-only, above reserve), `top_up` (anyone, to principal or a named allocation).
8. **Wallets (multi-chain).** Types: per-chain receive wallet set with one primary; sweep parameters (threshold, per-bridge cap). Functions: owner-controlled add/remove/change-primary; inbound-only auto-sweep to the primary under the agent capability, bounded and never outbound.
9. **Access & management.** Types: interaction gates (reach × payment), scoped passwords, manager whitelist (wallet → scope). Functions: gate checks at serving boundary; scope checks fail-closed for managers.
10. **Capability registry.** Types: provider_policy (capability id, version, pinned providers).
11. **Circuit breaker.** Types: PausedFlag, breaker thresholds. Functions: pause / resume.

## 34. Security Requirements and Threat Model

**34.1 The contract contains the model.** An autonomous agent that ingests external text can be prompt-injected; the contract must ensure a compromised model still cannot exceed caps, move funds off the character's own wallets, pay a non-allowlisted provider, or perform any owner-tier action.

**34.2 Move and contract-level requirements.** Capability checks over signature-validity checks; non-copyable capabilities; fail-closed on every verification; no upgrade authority.

**34.3 Key management.** Tiered keys; no long-lived plaintext spend key; master secret via owner OR M-of-N.

**34.4 Guardian and recovery.** Threshold + timelock + dispute window; no single guardian can trigger recovery or succession; no operator or provider is ever the guardian majority.

**34.5 Oracle and valuation.** Stale or low-confidence oracle reads fail closed; USD caps and runway computed from committed feeds.

**34.6 Treasury, swap, and bridge.** Allowlist + per-venue caps + slippage bound; delegated transfers only to own wallets; bridging principal always owner-signed and bounded per transit.

**34.6a Endowment, allocations, and heartbeat.** Allocation isolation is a contract invariant: no path moves funds between allocations except the metering allocator, which only flows yield inward. The heartbeat is authority-free and idempotent per epoch: it cannot exceed a fixed bounty, cannot move funds sideways, and no-ops before the epoch elapses, so a hostile or spamming caller gains nothing. Withdrawals are blocked below the keep-alive reserve minimum. Yield rebalances execute only within the owner's risk envelope; principal exit and bridging are owner-signed and never delegable.

**34.7 Attested compute.** Output bound to persona-hash and input; unattested hosts never see plaintext; bonds enable slashing of tampered inference.

**34.8 Payment and facilitator.** Facilitators cannot alter terms; pluggable with failover; no hardcoded single operator.

**34.9 Human and client layer.** The operating client is the trust boundary in the managed experience; self-custody keeps it local; passwords never substitute for decryption policy.

**34.10 Availability and economics.** Graceful degradation to dormant rather than death; substrate underfunding is the one terminal risk.

**34.11 Process requirements (not optional for launch).** Open-source contracts; published exit conditions and portability; the XEL-can-die CI chaos test.

## 35. Version 1 Build Plan and Acceptance Criteria

Phase 1 scope (§16): aNFT object, Proof of Genesis, encrypted access-gated storage, persona/memory commitments, one capability (`inference.v1`), agent capability, guardian recovery.

Acceptance: the XEL-can-die invariant passes as a CI chaos test on this minimal footprint; a live character answers, pays, and is ownable with every XEL service offline; key rotation on transfer verified; no admin key or upgrade authority present in deployed contracts.

## 36. Thousand-Year Survivability

**36.1 Cryptographic agility.** Today's signature schemes and hash functions will not last; schemes are replaceable parameters with an owner-authorized migration path, including post-quantum.

**36.2 Chain independence and escape.** Sui may not exist in a thousand years. Identity lives in the commitments, so an owner-authorized migration can re-home the character on a successor chain and storage.

**36.3 Storage and format longevity.** Encrypted memory must survive storage-network turnover; the substrate is retained and re-pinnable, and formats are migratable by regenerating the derived layer.

**36.4 Multi-generational succession.** Over centuries every guardian and heir dies; succession is designed to repeat indefinitely, rotating guardian sets and heirs across generations.

**36.5 Economic survival across epochs.** An endowment must outlast currencies and yield regimes; principal is denominated and diversifiable, and degradation is graceful rather than terminal.

**36.6 Institutional independence.** No company, XEL or any provider such as GEN, will exist in a thousand years, and the design assumes it. Nothing load-bearing depends on any one company's survival.

# Appendices

## Appendix A: The aNFT Object (Commitment-Oriented)

The full Move struct definitions live in the companion build specification (`xel-build-spec.md`, §2 `identity`), which is the formal reference for all on-chain types. In summary, the aNFT is an owned object with: an immutable `Genesis` sub-object (creator, timestamp, consent reference); versioned commitment fields (`persona_hash`, `memory_root`, `raw_data_root`, `policy_hash`) with a `lineage` vector recording every authorized transition; pointers to off-chain state (`encrypted_secrets`, `substrate_blobs`, `derived_blobs`, `manifest`, `site`) and an on-chain owner-set `handle` display label; a per-chain `wallets` map with one primary; and handles to the associated `endowment`, `guardian_set`, `manager_whitelist`, and `provider_policy`, an optional `agent_cap_id`, and a `paused` flag. Genesis immutability is structural: no function anywhere takes a mutable reference to it.

## Appendix B: Authority, Agent Capability, SpendPolicy, Two-Tier Entry

Full definitions in the build spec (§3 `authority`, §6 `wallet`). The `AgentCapability` is a non-copyable, delegate-bound object (`key` without `store`) carrying `per_call_cap`, `daily_cap`, `per_capability_budget`, `provider_allowlist`, an `Envelope` of permitted delegated actions, and `expires_at_ms`. Owner-tier entries take a mutable reference to the aNFT (only the owner holds it); delegated entries take the capability and pass `assert_in_envelope`. A valid signature is never sufficient, the capability check is what authorizes. Root actions (withdraw principal, transfer, edit whitelist, change the envelope) accept no capability parameter anywhere, which is the enforcement. The `SpendPolicy` tracks per-period running totals and fails closed on any cap breach.

## Appendix C: Guardian Recovery & Access Policy

Full definitions in the build spec (§4 `access_control`, §5 `guardian`). The `GuardianSet` is an M-of-N set (1 ≤ M ≤ |members|). Decryption and other sharp actions are gated by an owner-OR-M-of-N `AccessApproval` token, mintable only by the owner or a verified guardian threshold. Recovery/succession runs through a `RecoveryRequest` behind a timelock and a dispute window (owner or any guardian may dispute); finalization requires the threshold, an elapsed timelock, no dispute, and mandatory key rotation (re-encryption to the heir), after which ownership transfers with no downtime because the agent capability keeps running.

## Appendix D: Capability Schema Examples

Full request/response JSON for `inference.v1`, `ingestion.v1`, `retrieval.v1`, `treasury.v1`, `distillation.v1`, and the generation schemas `voice.v1`, `image.v1`, and `video.v1` (each with its usage-record dimensions), plus the public `mint` function and the two-phase hold/settle contract for variable-cost modalities, are in the build spec (§13 capability schemas, §8 settlement, §2 `mint`). Each schema carries the character's identity and the relevant commitment so a provider proves it ran the committed version, and every inference or generation response carries an attestation the contract verifies (fail closed). Concrete provider assignments for each schema are in Appendix E.

## Appendix E: Default Implementations (Configurable, Not Load-Bearing)

These are the concrete systems currently filling each capability slot. They are implementation choices, not part of the standard: any provider meeting a slot's requirements (accept programmatic crypto payments, permissionlessly joinable, verifiable/decentralized) can replace them. This appendix is expected to change over time without altering the body of the paper.

**Why Sui is the default across these slots.** Native object model (an aNFT owns its own memory, wallets, and agent capability natively). One integrated privacy stack: Walrus (encrypted storage), Seal (threshold encryption with on-chain access policy), and Nautilus (attested compute) interoperate as a native whole, and Seal's owner-OR-M-of-N gated decryption maps directly onto the key and crypto-shredding model (§9). Optional onboarding conveniences (sponsored/gasless transactions) layer on top of a self-custody root with no third-party dependency. Native delegation (capabilities are first-class objects, so the agent capability can be minted, handed to a delegate, and revoked natively). Treasury: keeping principal on the home chain co-locates funds with the object that owns them, and the current best stablecoin yield (suiUSDe) is Sui-native.

The rationale rests on identity and privacy (the hard parts), not yield, payments, or liquidity (commodity layers). Honest counterweights: the cleaner machine-payment standard (x402) is not native to Sui, so XEL hosts its own facilitator; and the deepest liquidity and most-audited bridges still live on Ethereum and Solana. The primary chain remains owner-changeable via the chain-adapter design (§10.1).

| Slot | Current default(s) | Permissionless successor |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership & settlement | Sui | Already decentralized |
| Receive wallets (default set) | Primary: Sui. Additional receive-only: Solana, Base. Each auto-sweeps to the primary above an owner-set threshold; owner can add/remove chains and change which is primary | Any chain with a treasury adapter; owner-configured set |
| Encrypted storage | Walrus | Already decentralized |
| Key access / encryption | Seal | Already decentralized |
| Attested compute (orchestration + small models) | Nautilus (Sui-native, AWS Nitro Enclaves) | Multiple TEE vendors, then ZKML |
| Attested compute (large-model private inference) | Phala Network (Intel TDX + NVIDIA H100/H200 GPU TEEs) | Additional GPU-TEE networks, then zkML |
| Attested compute (alt) | Marlin (Oyster) | Additional coprocessor networks |
| Relay | XEL-run relayer (Mysten pluggable pattern) | Many operators; relayer-in-TEE |
| Inference (text) | GPU inference providers / Bittensor subnets | Many providers per schema |
| Voice generation (STT + TTS, message and real-time) | GEN voice pipeline (default); metered by output speech length or session duration | Any provider meeting `voice.v1`; multiple STT/TTS vendors |
| Image generation | GEN image pipeline (default); metered by resolution, steps, prompt length, reference-image count | Any provider meeting `image.v1` |
| Video generation | GEN video pipeline (default); metered by clip count, duration, resolution, frame rate | Any provider meeting `video.v1` |
| Payment standard | x402 (HTTP-native stablecoin payments), pay-per-call preferred and default | Any standard with the same properties |
| Provider payment method | Crypto-native pay-per-call by default (no key). Some launch providers may be key-based (operator-held account) as a bridge; swappable for a crypto-native equivalent as they emerge, and never attached to the character | Direction is pay-per-call everywhere; key-based fillers shrink toward zero |
| Payment facilitator | XEL-hosted x402 on Sui at launch | Anyone runs a facilitator; client-configurable + failover |
| Card-to-crypto on-ramp | Stripe (optional, for paid interactions) | Any on-ramp; crypto-native path always works |
| Interaction gate | Serving-layer reach × payment gates + scoped passwords (memory tiers) | Any serving provider meeting the schema |
| Endowment / allocation accounting | On-chain Move `endowment` module (principal + ring-fenced allocations) | Native to any object-centric chain |
| Yield harvest (heartbeat) | Permissionless authority-free trigger, contract-paid bounty; launch keeper is a third-party network (candidate: Talus Leaders) sending XEL's own heartbeat tx for the stablecoin bounty | Incentivized keeper network; any bot, owner scheduler, or heir can compete for the bounty |
| Yield strategy (advisor) | XEL reference strategy in a Nautilus enclave (proposes within owner envelope) | Any attested strategy provider; owner-bounded |
| Treasury execution | Home = Sui; Suilend / NAVI / Scallop lending; suiUSDe (~9–12%, variable) and USDsui; Haedal liquid staking (~2.5–3%) | Any venue meeting policy; multi-venue with allowlist, caps, failover |
| Protocol fee | Disclosed on-chain, targeting ~10%: routing fee on interaction credits and discretionary storage, plus a fee on yield; keep-alive at cost, principal never touched; zero if self-provisioned | Fully avoidable by self-routing |
| Price oracle | Pyth (Sui-native pull oracle) | Switchboard, Supra; multiple networks |
| Swap | Aggregators: 7k, Aftermath, Hop over Cetus, DeepBook, Bluefin | Any aggregator meeting the policy |
| Bridge | Sui Bridge (validator-operated, native ETH) default; Wormhole, ZetaChain for wider reach | Most-audited bridge per route; per-bridge caps |
| Cross-chain custody | Ika (MPC dWallets), LayerZero (omnichain) | Additional MPC / messaging networks |
| Discovery index | Open x402 indexes (402 Index, CDP Bazaar, x402scan) | Already open/federated |
| Ingestion / persona-update | GEN orchestration + quality layer (social and document); commodity transforms subcontracted | Open ingestion spec; competing providers |
| Memory & retrieval | LlamaIndex (hybrid dense + sparse retrieval), Graphiti (temporal knowledge graph for the relational store), optional agentic layer; all behind `retrieval.v1`, operated by XEL at launch but run inside attested compute so plaintext is never exposed to the operator | Any engine meeting the schema; swappable, index regenerable from committed substrate |
| Data extraction | Commodity providers (transcription, OCR, embeddings), called by the orchestrator | Any provider meeting the schema |
| Contribution review | Permissioned queue, encrypted on decentralized storage; owner-signed approval merges | Open; owner or delegated reviewers |
| Media / STT / TTS / moderation / publishing | Commercial providers initially | Swappable per schema |
| Public hosting | One shared client app on Walrus Sites (a single site object), rendering any character by object ID via client-side routing; served through a portal (default operator-run) | Already decentralized; portals are permissionless (anyone can run one), app is one fixed artifact not per-character |
| Handle / naming | On-chain owner-set display label per character (not unique, no registry); operator-hosted reverse-lookup index powers `@handle` convenience URLs | Object ID is the true name and permanent link; handle index is disposable operator convenience |
| Keeper / scheduler | Launch keeper is a third-party network (candidate: Talus Leaders) firing XEL's permissionless heartbeat for the stablecoin bounty (Path A); XEL adopts no keeper's workflow, gas, or token system. Costs no trust: the heartbeat is authority-free and can take nothing but the fixed bounty | Incentivized keeper network; the slot is permissionless and competitive, no keeper is hardcoded or load-bearing |
| Custody / gas | Self-custody wallet (user holds keys, no third-party dependency); sponsored gas optional; login-based onboarding optional, not required | Self-custody default |
| Wallet / signer | Owner signer default (Phantom, Sui support); delegate = operator key holding the agent capability; hardware wallet for sharp actions | Any wallet meeting the standard |
| Free tier (operator-sponsored) | XEL, as operator, sponsors a limited free experience to remove onboarding friction: limited text conversation and initial mint, paid by XEL, not the endowment. Voice, image, and video are always paid (fan or endowment). Free mint is open for now; a gate may be added later | Operator-level perk, optional and non-load-bearing; if XEL is absent, minting is self-paid and interaction is paid or endowment-funded, and the character is unaffected |

**Deepest hidden dependency to track:** the Sui-native attested-compute default roots its attestation in AWS Nitro, and GPU-TEE providers root in their respective chip and cloud vendors. TEE attestation is therefore a hardware trust assumption at every layer of the compute slot. It's acceptable as a default, but it's the reason "multiple TEE vendors, then ZKML" is a roadmap item, not just a caveat.

## Appendix F: Open Questions and Unsolved Problems

Honesty about what is not yet solved is part of the specification. None of these block the version 1 scope (§35); all sit in later phases.

1. **Private inference at frontier scale.** TEE attestation is a hardware trust assumption, and zkML cannot yet prove a large model's output. Running the brain privately on fully untrusted hardware, with a proof it ran the committed persona, is real for small models and a vendor-trust story for large ones. Expected to stay partly open for some time.
2. **Autonomy while the owner is gone (the heartbeat).** No chain offers native, self-firing scheduling, so the endowment's epoch cycle must be triggered by an external transaction. The design resolves the *authority* problem (the heartbeat is permissionless, authority-free, and bounty-paid, so anyone can send it and it can take nothing, §10.4), but it cannot remove the need for *someone* to send it. If no one ever does, the character coasts on existing allocation balances and degrades gracefully rather than losing funds or control. A live, incentivized, decentralized keeper network is the remaining maturity item.
3. **Death detection and the succession trigger.** Reliably detecting a creator's death without false positives (guardian thresholds, timeouts, dispute windows, protection against premature triggering) is underspecified and load-bearing for inheritance.
4. **Consent verification for a real person, especially posthumously.** On-chain a signature is checkable; binding it to the actual human, or to a legitimate estate, is an off-chain identity problem. This is the core legal risk of the category and tends to surface with the first real user.
5. **Persona fidelity.** There is no defined way to fully measure whether a character faithfully represents the person, or to fully detect drift as model and memory change. Mitigations are in the design (disclosed fidelity signal, deferral over confabulation, versioned persona), but a rigorous general evaluation and drift-monitoring methodology remains open.
6. **Trustless yield discovery.** There is no on-chain, verifiable ranking of the best-yielding venues. The design bounds this by making the yield scanner an *advisor* that can only propose within the owner's risk envelope, and by running it in an attested enclave so its proposal is verifiable (§10.5). But sourcing a genuinely trust-minimized, decentralized yield signal remains open; today it rests on the owner's allowlist plus an attested advisor, not on a trustless oracle.
7. **Money transmission and creator tax reporting.** Paid interactions plus creator withdrawals plus metered compute pull an operator into money-transmission and creator-tax-reporting regimes, heavier than minting alone. Scope and jurisdiction handling to be specified before creator-charged mode ships broadly.
8. **Foreign-chain signing before MPC is wired.** The target for Solana and Base spending is MPC dWallets (§9), where no key is ever assembled and ownership authorizes each signature. Until the MPC integration is live, a launch may use a permit- or delegate-based bridge, but only under the labeled, non-custodial conditions in §9 (user/embedded-held key, never a XEL server key, disclosed as interim with MPC as the destination). This is a genuine gap, not a design choice: a permit/delegate scheme leaves a real key in a holder's hands, so it cannot match MPC's clean-transfer or survive-every-party properties, and it must be retired to MPC per chain as the integration proves out. Stated here at equal visibility with the resolved items so it is never mistaken for the resting state.
